ML-India is an initiative to get all activities related to machine learning in india under one roof. Check out our analysis on the current publication record of researcher in India at top ML-conferences at ml-india.org/insightsWe would be happy to interact with people in Bangalore and Chennai who might want to promote chapters of ML-India in their cities.Some initiatives that we have started off with this year includes having interviews of people, both in academia and industry, working in ML and also growing our database of companies who use ML as one of the key components in their products. We could discuss if anyone wants to lead such initiatives in these cities specifically.The team would be in Bangalore from 4 Feb to 7 Feb and will be in Chennai on 8 and 9 Feb. Please feel free to drop in a line to shashank...@aspiringminds.com to set up a time to have a chat. Looking forward.ShashankResearch blog: Learn more about what we doASSESS 2015: Our annual international workshop on data-driven assessmentsData science for kids: Our fun initiative to teach kids data science

Both measure a different range of parameters, CPCB fewer parameters than CWC. Historical data is available for download, in many cases 20 years or more.You can mail/call WRIS if you have difficulty accessing data. They are cooperative, in my experience.The data could be visualized in many ways, better than the WRIS website does it.Will be great to see what you come up with.One of issues with surface water quality though is that there aren't enough stations across the country, and this is an issue near bigger industrial polluting areas The range of parameters the existing stations measure is also inadequate to capture industrial pollution. Thus we really need to provide some space for citizen monitoring of water quality.Urban pollution (sewage) and even some agricultural pollution (nitrates) it may capture well.Let me know your comments once you explore more.BestCraig "

Except that the files are very large, formated (netcdf, which is not a problem in most of the mapping programs).Â http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds083.2/index.html#!descriptionWe use WRF meteorological to downscale this systematically for the years in need. Over India, we work with the attached domain @ 0.25 degree resolution and @ 1 hour temporal resolution. Multiple fields from WRF go into dispersion models for pollution models, but five elements which are most useful are - wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, mixing heights, and temperature. We run WRF and archive these minimum parameters for modeling purposes. Again, very large files.WRF model - http://wrf-model.org/index.phpFYI, IMD uses the same databases and the same meteorological model at higher horizontal and vertical resolutions (using bigger servers).WRF can be run in forecast (using GFS fields) and hindcast mode (using NCEP fields)For examplehindcast - http://www.delhiairquality.info/meteorologyforecast - http://www.delhiairquality.info/daqi-meteo/(Delhi system runs @ 0.01 degree resolution in a nested mode)ProposalWe can run the WRF model for multiple years and archive the data over India @ 0.25 degree resolution.Can one of you or many of you, build a query portal where a user inputs latitude and longitude (say for Bengaluru) and the year in need (time range), and the system extracts the information for the five parameters listed above from this WRF modeled data archive (not the raw data from NCEP).

30,Raphael Susewind,#topic/datameet/S9Xr1a5pcmM,7,2016-01-31 22:34:00,Re: [datameet] Bhuvan Derived Data Copyright Question (Shapefile data),"Dear all,

what I would find particularly useful is a (tentative) legal answer to
the question at which degree of data curation copyright kicks in.

As I understand, Indian copyright law knows the concept of ""factual
data"" which is exempt from copyright (in that it seems quite similar to
US law). Curation of data attracts copyright, though.

I rely on this distinction quite a lot for my work with election data,
assuming that results published by the Election Commission, or more
precisely the fact that candidate X pulled Y votes in locality Z are
""factual data"". If we as a group curate or improve upon (clean up etc)
this data, the information itself remains factual, but the curation
effort attracts copyright (which we can then lift under open licenses -
for instance this one: http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/).

My legal question is after what level of curation data ceased to be
factual only. If the Election Commission tabulates it into a PDF, is
that already copyrighted? If we do not redistribute the PDF, but just
its contents, what does this imply for copyright? Or does copyright only
kick in after more complex operations, such as creating maps or other
""expressions"" as you called it?

It seems that this transition from factual to copyrighted data is a
blurry but important one, and it would be useful to have some legal
guidance on borderline cases - especially when public data is not
expressly licensed (earlier versions of GIS data from the ECI had no
legal disclaimer, for example - so what about these? Later versions have
an express disclaimer that one is not to reuse it. Which is fine - if
the data owner/curator asks for something, one should obey. But the
borderline cases concern a lot of our work here)...

My 5 cents for the lawyers ;-)

Raphael

31,Nikhil VJ,#topic/datameet/S9Xr1a5pcmM,8,2016-02-03 21:14:00,Re: [datameet] Bhuvan Derived Data Copyright Question (Shapefile data),"Hi,

Also (with a real lawyer's help of course) look into these angles:

Is the govt of India a privately held company or is it owned by the
people of India?
Is data whose assimilation and curation was paid for using taxes
collected from citizens of India.. then not the property of the
citizens of India?
Is government property actually public property held in stewardship by
the govt on behalf of the citizens it represents (similar to power of
attorney), or is it exclusive private property irrsepective of who has
paid for it?
If a citizen of India makes use of data that has been paid for by
citizens of India, is that not rightful use?

I know the systems as of today are in some other boat as far as these
questions are concerned, carrying their own assumptions that conflict
with these points. But these questions can be useful in challenging
the systems.

Some proxy activism might also work out.. for example, what if an
elected representative publishes such data using the same principle of
representation of people that a govt agency uses to claim its rights
over it? If we can get a sitting MP or MLA or even corporator or
sarpanch on board, will the govt agency be that willing to go hammer
and tongs after them?

Else, even opposition political parties might be happy to publish the
data ""on behalf of the people"". And human rights, activist groups like
NAPM too.

Also, how about this thought-germ:
Any geographical data is first and foremost the property of the
citizens residing upon the territory that said geographical data
covers. So the ward boundaries of Pune are firstly the property of the
residents living within those boundaries. The groundwater data of
Maharashtra region is firstly property of all Indian citizens residing
in Maharashtra. Someone else cannot claim ownership over that data
even if they have taken efforts or spent money to create it, as that
is seen as a plublic service rendered to those residents.

I guess the underlying idea behind this, which directly conflicts with
official copyright laws discussed here is : the people own the
government.

Awesome. How did you do this? It's pretty darn cool = the pincode sub-
site I mean.

http://pincode.net.in/ has 152,000 pin codes, and we could use
wikiscraper or a custom program to get them.

We could run through the pin-code search at http://www.indiapost.gov.in/Pin/Pinsearch.aspx
and get a list of pin codes (gotta do a scraper).

Then use Google Geocoder which has a simple API, just pass
sensor=false&address=[city], India [pincode]. You'll most likely get a
few results, wtih lat/lng, put that into the database, let the crowd
come in and choose the PO directly or choose of of them options.

> 3. Any thoughts on how we can merge this with the efforts of hundreds of

Who else is doing this?

One way to handle overlaps is a) announce it and b) create an api for
people to use (say GetGeoAddress given PinCode). If you know of any of
the overlaps, why don't we list 'em and let's contact everyone and get
the pieces flowing.

Lets not get into this right now.
2) Associating pincodes to place names. This is more approximate and is much more doable. The pincode data in osm is mostly in this form where the point data signifying the location of a city/town/suburb/village has an additional pincode attribute. It might actually be possible to try and automatically geocode a good number of Indian pincodes if we can have an open database of:
A) Geocoded place names. Once again osm is the largest source of such data with cc-by-sa license. Having gone through a lot of osm data, i can say that locations of all major cities and towns are quite accurate. In a few remote areas without road data the positional accuracy drops, sometimes upto ~5km, but otherwise the positions are spot on
Location of villages however are not so good and may have errors of upto ~20km in remote regions. But then again the village data is not very comprehensive and only notable ones are there.While there are plenty of data sources for geocoded place names, the majority of them are not compatible with the cc-by-sa license because it contains data derived from non free datasets and services like google maps (this may practically be ok, but it is in fact illegal and the derived data belongs to google as per the TOS). Wikipedia and geonames both have such polluted data.
See http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potential_Datasources for a comprehensive listing of usable data sources.B) Pincode database. This is going to be very tricky because i'm quite sure none of the existing listings on government sites would be compatible with the cc-by-sa license. If we somehow manage to get permission to use the data under this license, it would be possible to match the pincode data with the place names in the osm data and merge them.
***If the aim is to build a pure creative commons dataset, then you can be rest assured that nobody else has done it for India and this effort is unique and not a duplication of work. Further, to build such a comprehensive database of geocoded pincodes is not an easy task, You may want to have a look at UK's Free the postcode project for an idea of the scale of data collection.-- j.mp/ArunGanesh

unique institutions with unique locations - do we choose any one

This is a problem that we spend good amount of time on at Taazza. A
couple of quick thoughts on our learnings that you might find useful

- Scraping of pincode site data
   We tried this and were largely successfully but for a few issues
with HTTP post. We realized that it was cheaper to buy the data out
for 2K. Happy to opensource the script out. The data should be lying
around somewhere. Let me know.

- Be very cautious with the data from India Post. It isnt upto date
and has loads of typos and has no standards so can be useless.

- Here are some numbers that can be of help.
  There needs to be about 30K+ plus pincode as in 560102 (Postal code
offers only 20K odd)
  The number of localities within the pincode is lot more - Postal
code only covers 150K Actually numbers are in the millions

- Geonames
  The problem is geonames is the data is bad. IMHO, its better to
start off with limited data that is correct rather than wrong data.
May be this would be of help.

- Geocoding of data thru Google
   If you intend to make the data available as a DUMP you cannot do
so. License restrictions prevent it.

- Alternate source of data
  Yahoo Geoplanet data is good place to start and get folks to geocode
it on top.

In our case we needed this data as a location dictionary for our
semantic engine. You can check for pincodes at http://beta.taazza.com
- use the search box. - Data isnt perfect but a good start.

The million number comes from the fact that the Indian government
actually has the data available and a good number of them are geocoded
as well. Unfortunately they have it in their own system and the values
arent available. The good piece is that the data is available as a
hierarchy which means that if you approach it top down you can iterate
much faster. Arun as far I have heard, has done more work in this and
can probably comment on this.

Also you might want to look at http://linkedgeodata.org/ - There is
lot to be achieved by making this data linked. For instance being able
to query by wikipedia/dbpedia id.

Hope this helps. Let us know if we can be of help.

Really? Even if we used just the latitude/longitude portions? Quite
interesting.
Using googlemaps to geocode would mean the resulting database is a derivative work of those maps. This breaks 2(b) of the Google Maps Terms of service. One of the biggest databases of crowdsourced map content - wikimapia is locked up because of this. Same is the case with coordinates in wikipedia articles, most of which have been geocoded with a google map based tool.  To avoid license lockdown of the data, its best to stay clear of google maps.

Arun (or anyone else), any guidance on why we have these differences? Which one do you think is more accurate? A quick glance reveals that many pincodes have the same lat/lon for different pincodes in the geonames data. I think its safe to say that the GN data is much more erroneous than the AND/OSM data. Just sort the cells by the lat values and you'll see what i mean. 
I have no idea how AND managed to geocode the pincodes but it seems like they did a pretty good job. I checked 5 random pincodes from the AND data on google and it matched quite closely, And yes, all the openstreetmap data is cc-by-sa 2.0.

Attached is the osm xml data of all Indian placenames extracted from the openstreetmap database. I recommend exploring the data and attribute tags using josm. For visualizations like what I created you can play with maperitive. Be warned that the data may have inconsistent tags due to various users contributing data. It can be corrected and updated on the osm server using josm (but be very careful and make sure you know what you are doing).
The data of interest, if you look into the .osm file is the postal_code tag. I have extracted all nodes with a place attribute, and not all of them have the pincode data.

Here are ways you can contribute:1. If you know of any other liberally licensed data sources with the latitude and longitude of PIN codes, let me know (or fork the code and upload it)
2. Even if you had an authoritative list of post codes and names (without lat/lng -- just the list), that'd be of great help too.3. Any thoughts on how we can merge this with the efforts of hundreds of others doing the same thing are welcome. Hate to overlap effort.

I am reviving this old thread to ask whether anyone has Form 20 election
results for Maharashtra 2014 Assembly Polls in a usable format (csv,
json, xml, whatever - but not scanned pdf...)?

The PDFs are online on the CEO website, but before I go to the trouble

If not, I shall put them on the datameet github in a few weeks...

Unlike previous sessions which were longer presentations by single individuals this session will be a 'Roundtable' to brainstorm on ideas. Several individuals have individually been working on open and public data related to Pune city and we wish to give them a space to present their work briefly and get feedback from the larger Datameet Pune community on data generation/collection/analysis/visualization etc. The tentative programme of the Roundtable will be as follows11 am - 11.45 am: Brief 6-8 min presentation of ideas by individuals11.45 am - 1 pm: Break off into groups to discuss individual ideas in detail.1pm -1.30pm: Gather together and present the outcomes of group discussionsWe therefore call people to submit a short 2-3 line description of their individual ideas at pu...@datameet.org by the 12th of January, so we can develop a detailed programme.

I am not attempting the attribute linking right now because that will be a bigger effort.I tried to georeference it. My approach was as follows. So far I have not used any transformations which distorts the shape as it was in the PDF file.I imported each district separately and have been able to match them with each other to make the whole of Gujarat using only MOVE, SCALE (EQUAL XY) and ROTATE. Practically I used the Autocad ALIGN command. Which means I have exactly same shape as in PDF files. Then I thought I will guess the original projection and see if it matches and then reproject it rather than Doing any rubbersheeting/other arbritrary distortions to shape.I tried LCC projection for India , UTM 43N, and LL84 in that order. They do not seem to match. Anyone may suggest any other possible projection. Otherwise I will check it and share it as it is.This is the summary of the Data : 33 districts : 114 Polylines in Autocad (because of Islands and enclaves)379 Taluka Polylines20128 Village polylines15804 Text names16137 Markers manly the Village dot."

    Dear Dilip:

    the projection depends upon the source. In most cases, the only
    source that exists is the Census district handbook maps. These in
    turn have been prepared from taluka level maps that the Directorate
    of Land Records and Survey Settlement creates from village-level
    cadastral maps. Now this method by definition means there is no
    original projection system, and that these maps are not
    geo-corrected (not terrain-corrected) as the originals are based on
    chain survey and plain table surveys, not theodolite surveys. So
    unless someone has done some correction work before creating the
    maps you used, they would have significant limitations in terms of
    geo-referencing. Our experience (we created the Karnataka layer from
    scratch, by digitizing the individual taluka-level village boundary
    maps by hand) tells us RMS errors of 2-3km for the state as a whole
    would be normal. What we did was to georeference by matching the
    state boundary so created to the Survey of India state boundary,
    which is available and is a properly projected layer. (Simply
    creating a prj file for the existing map does not work, because the
    scans will be anyway in centimetre or mm or inch units. So you need
    pucca geo-rectification.) Fairly easily done in QGIS.

    I hope this helps. Am still digging for the layers we supposedly
    have.

Some days back Vinoth had mentioned about OnlineRTI.com where you can apply RTI online for any govt in India and they take care of drafting and all other formalities. 
This month PayTM is sponsoring social RTIs on the site. Digital dataset is very much a social RTI. 
You mentioned series of RTIs at different level, you can do on the site for free. All it needs is creating a PayTM account, you can read more here onlinerti.com/paytm

Even the latest TIGER data for the US has flaws and is a reminder of the dangers of trusting any data source blindly.I just checked the Bhandara sample overlayed with OSM and satellite imagery and its clearly not as accurate as the existing OSM roads. Many of the village roads seem completely off from where they should be.https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/126868/11376252/a9180be0-9305-11e5-8978-48360238ff2e.png (red=sample, white=OSM)This is not very useful to import, but could be a useful reference layer to find missing roads and add road classifications and names. You think this would be ok?Also if its ok, I can share the interactive visualization on the list.--

I agree with not wanting to re-invent the wheel, but depending only on top-down sources (which btw would even have the roads in remote areas that exist only on paper or are in disrepair) and not putting any energy into nurturing bottom-up ways might not be a good idea.So how about going interdisciplinary with this: Popularize the apps that make it easy for regular people to contribute.Orgs taking this up as a project can get interns to go on field and cover all the roads in a dark (on OSM ie) area.A cycling championship could be done where the prize goes to the contestant who covered the most amount of yet-unmarked kms of roads in a given timeframe. Cycling enthusiast groups can find unmapped areas to decide the next expedition and cover them.So working on making the contributing of GPS traces and such data to OSM easier for regular people might also be a good long term strategy for increasing the coverage.--Cheers,Nikhil+91-966-583-1250Pune, IndiaSelf-designed learner at Swaraj University <http://www.swarajuniversity.org>http://nikhilsheth.blogspot.in

Many thanks for pointing us to this link, where the 2011 pdf maps have 
now been uploaded.

1. I could not find any urban ward-level boundaries in the pdf. I only 
see taluk-wise or tehsil-wise maps in which village boundaries are 
shown, and also the urban area is marked as a whole. But no ward 
boundaries within the urban area. Am I missing something?

2. About shapefile: Ah! this is the eternal battle! As I said in an 
earlier post, census MUST be having all these boundaries digitized, and 
has in fact boasted in an internal presentation that they have 
sub-ward-level maps. But they refuse to acknowledge that when we 
approach them. Maybe someone should file an RTI.

Till then we have to take the shapefiles we have (such as the one I

Sorry, the statement-ward level is wrong, it is village or town level. I was referring to ""Town code/Village code"" in census data, which is marked in the pdf maps and it is the lowest level, unique code in the map. The ward level data in census tables (population enumeration tables or house listing tables) doesn't has a unique code and is linked with Town code/Village code as its serial numbers.      



	
	
	
	
	2. Regarding the shape file, this link would be a good start for 2001 census data village map https://archive.org/details/IndiaVillageBoundaries. Though incomplete, the data has boundary for some 2,80,000 villages.Regards,Nishadh"

    Dear Sudheendra:

    Well, you know how right hand does not know what left hand has done.

    Please see the ppt that Census person made to NSDI in 2011:

    They claim to have ward boundaries for more than 7,000 towns

    Here is an update from my colleague who tried to get these maps:

I called Delhi folks. Apparently, town with ward boundary maps
      are not available for public dissemination at the moment for any
      state. He asked me to purchase the state map book (which is
      available online) for the all the maps they have. 

    Clearly, RTI is called for.

Python codes can be used for converting those json files into shape files. Using geopandas library the task is simple for such a large number of files, the code goes as follows,import geopandas as gpdimport globfrom geopandas import GeoDataFramejsn=glob.glob(""/home/me/raw-json-102-241/*.json"")#getting the list of json file in the folderdf1=pd.DataFrame()for js in jsn:    dd = gpd.read_file(js)    dd1=dd[[u'DIST_NAME', 'NAME', 'OBJECTID','STAT_NAME', u'TEHS_NAME', u'geometry']]    df1=df1.append(dd1)#looping over each json file and opening it with geopandas cool tool read_file(json)db1 = GeoDataFrame(df1, columns=[u'DIST_NAME', 'NAME', 'OBJECTID','STAT_NAME', u'TEHS_NAME', u'geometry'], index=df1.index)#organizing the looped shape formats and converting into geodataframe#now saving the shape file!db1.to_file('v102-241.shp',driver='ESRI Shapefile')2. There is a web map service(WMS) for this same data (I am little sure!) 2001 census map upto village/town level. See this link for more info http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/115876 to use that WMS in QGIS. Here also the data is not available in readily usable format, it is available in raster format (aka pdf format!).  3. I think the RTI can be stress it out for shape files or form of data which can be ""used"" not only for simple ""view"". Moreover the RTI can be more emphasis to the demand on already published data as pdf files/WMS such as village or town level map, as the ward level map is not published, it can raise the denial of RTI. "

However, this feature limits you to view only 7 days at a time. After you click the view button for 7 days, it shows a line or a bar graph, but the data cannot be downloaded as a csv or txt or xlsx. But, I am guessing that the data is available as a table for the same to have it graphed as such.There is a Chinese site http://aqicn.org/city/delhi/r.k.-puram which is hacking the dpcc site to extract the data in real time, convert that to an index number and host it. I have contacted them, but they refused to share what they are downloading, given that the data is already in the open domain. We sent emails to DPCC office and received the same answer saying, we are already putting everything on the web and open. Just that it is not easy to download the archives. I am sure many of you have seen news on AQ in Delhi. Good, bad, and the ugly. We want to put together some notes on the trends, to go with the source apportionment work we doing for the city (and many others). Can somebody help us with a code to extract the data from the DPCC site from 2010 (1-2 of the stations started operating around CWG)Total six stations1-hour data required for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO, NO2, CO, and OzoneTime period 2010 to currentWith regards,Sarath--Dr. Sarath Guttikundahttp://www.urbanemissions.info

minutes and also forward this to friends and relatives! Warning, can get addictive.http://crowdcrafting.org/project/localpunebudget[explanation follows.. warning : slightly technical]As part of our (CEE's) ongoing work on participatory governance, I recently brought together all the expenditures mentioned 
in Pune's Budget book (by taking only the 2015-16 amount allocation and 
dropping all the myriad other columns which keep changing from section to section):You can download a copy for your use here:Simplified and Combined Expenditures, Pune 2015-16 Budget Book(note: don't jump at the total.. many repetitions are there as sections and sub-sections are mixed in here, along with transfers from Revenue to Capital which become double entries)And that led to a finding: Out
 of 9,614 budget items listed, about 1,997 do 
not have any ward number or whole-city marking alloted. In the ""ward"" 
column, that is. Though many of these are very clearly belonging to a 
specific ward when you read the budget item. It would be 
great if we could assign the the proper ward numbers to these works : we
 would then have a more accurate picture about the public investment made in 
various wards of Pune.Meanwhile, in a mailing list far far away...While headbanging on polling booth locations data (too messed up, dude!), I was referred to a platform called ""Crowdcrafting"" wherein one 
can crowdsource tasks for science and civic hacking purposes. It's different from regular survey forms in this way : Form: Exact same question asked to 1000 people, 1000 responses to one question. Many to one. Crowdcrafting : 1000 different questions (of similar structure but different content) split among 1000 people (or more if you use redundancy feature), each chipping in a little bit. 1000 separate Q-A pairs obtained at end of exercise. Each to each.Kind of like how we used to leak the question paper before exams with very little time on hand and each one would figure out one... [whoops! censored! you never saw this! look away!]So the task of finding the missing wards, 
became a great pilot project to try out and learn how to use this platform. With a lot of one-on-one help from one of the website's developers (basically got him to write the main code and then did cosmetic adjustments), I was able to get a project up and running. So, if you'd like to check it out, click below: Click the image or here to be taken to the project page.
 On hitting ""Contribute"", you will be taken to a super-comfortable interface, in 
which all relevant information is loaded up for you.. all you have to do
 is type the correct number, and press Enter. As soon as you do that, 
the next item will load for you automatically. Screenshot:​There's more details in the page and even a map embedded below so you can figure out which ward a particular area comes under. USP of this method is that we can eke out one contribuion in as little as a minute : it's made really simple and easy for the contributor, and so we can maximize the number of contributors.Next steps, maybe a few weeks down the line: I'll try to make a simplified walkthrough that should help one to set up their crowdsourcing project here. Will share it when made. There's a lot of possbilities here, like geo-tagging, transcripting scanned docs, recognizing plant species, etc. If you can put your stuff and accompanying data in an excel file, then you can use this. I'm also wondering if we can use this for transcripting / translation of books / films. But the platform isn't a point-and-click one.. while things get very easy for the citizen contributor, for the project creator there's some amount of coding needed, so we need to systemize things and give a good explanation. Your feedback would be most appreciated. If you're interested in trying this out for another project, let's connect! (at slow pace, kindly note)Oh, and we do need those ward numbers filled in soon. Are you familiar with Pune? Please contribute just a few minutes and also forward this to friends and relatives!

I've put on github Gist the Task Presenter code and a sample 
tasks CSV of my pune-budget-localization project. These are the only two inputs really required (technically speaking!) to start off a crowdcrafting project.Some pointers:<span id=""code""></span><span id=""work""></span>>> these <span> tags in the HTML are placeholders for the values to be loaded from the CSV. Place them as you please in your HTML.In the CSV, you have to have stored one task per row, with differnt values that you want to show (like code, name, department, etc) put into different columns. These will be your input values only : don't think about the output yet.In the <script> code:$(""#code"").text(task.info.Code);$(""#work"").text(task.info.Work);>> This is how the value at the CSV column is loaded into its corresponding <span> objects when the page loadsThe way the answer that the contributor provides is stored : I complicated the code on my end to bring in validation etc, but here's a rough logic:On pressing the button, the value entered by user is to be stored in a variable named ""answer"", and then this line is executed:pybossa.saveTask(task.id, answer).done(function() { deferred.resolve(task); });So whatever input(s) you're taking, when the button is hit by the contributor, make sure you've stuffed everything you need in answer.If you took mulitple values, then either string it all up with proper delimiters, or make JSON array and pass that into the ""answer"" variable. (I only took one input element in my task so don't have experience yet with multiple, but this is what the developer Alejandro told me)At the end of it all, you'll get a CSV/JSON with the ""answer""s stored in one column, and another column having task_id which is your key to tie it in with the questions (you re-download the tasks CSV/JSON too which by now has a ton of extra columns generated by the system, one of which is task_id). If you used their redundancy feature (ie, two or more people will be asked the same question so you can ferret out junk) then multiple columns having the multiple versions of the answer.--Cheers,Nikhil+91-966-583-1250Pune, IndiaSelf-designed learner at Swaraj University <http://www.swarajuniversity.org>http://nikhilsheth.blogspot.in

Group size: ~15Issues to Discuss: Form and format of data and their implications for data use and abuse. The session will focus on two possibilities in particular – the tensions between transparency and privacy; and the opportunity costs that restrictive data formats create for innovation. Structure: We will use two cases of “civic data” initiatives on crime data and transport to ground the discussion. Anchors Anant Mariganti and Jessica Seddon present two cases and outline some of the key issues involved in evaluating the data format (20 minutes). Participants in 2 breakout sessions thrash out the issues (45 minutes), and then reconvene to share the discussions (30 minutes).  We will conclude the session with a facilitated discussion meant to collate insights and hammer out a statement that can be shared more widely (20 minutes). This initial formulation would ideally be the kernel of a kind of code of ethics, a checklist for considering the costs and benefits of various data release formats, and suggestions for incorporation in upcoming public and private initiatives meant to increase transparency of civic data.

With Open Data released by government, public is able to get a peek into everyday governance issues affecting the society. Hence, if one is able to derive meaningful insights from such data, multiple non-traditional stakeholders like citizens, businesses and government at all level benefit.The COMAD Data Challenge Contest “DataView” (the “Contest”) tries to: (a) bring attention of machine learning community to open data, (b) show application of state-of-the-art techniques to societal and governance issues, and (c) promote new useful apps. It will try to strike a balance between learning new insights and build software (apps) that can help make the insights available easily to the decision makers. During the contest period, we will identify a set of open datasets and ask the participants to discover actionable insights. CHALLENGE FORMATThe Contest will be carried out in two rounds.Round 1 will be about generating insights using data and learning methods. Deliverable will be a presentation report.Round 2 will be about building an app (web or mobile) using APIs corresponding to open data.

Guest Post: Varun Goel- Releasing Data for Agriculture
by Nisha Thompson 




Varun is a researcher at ISB, led by Dr. Ashwini Chhatre, serves as the Research Node of the Revitalizing Rainfed Agricultural Network - an India wide network of NGOs, civil society organizations, researchers, policy makers and think-tanks that aim to reconfigure the nature, amount and delivery of public investments for productive and resilient rainfed agriculture. 
The Combined Finance and Revenue Accounts (CFRA) report is an annual report prepared by the office  of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India to provides comprehensive Union and State government data on audited receipts, revenue expenditures and capital outlay for different major, minor and sub-minor heads.
Since the figures for actual expenditures on different heads may differ from actual  budget allocation by as much 15 to 20 percent, and that each state might have different procedures of auditing, the CFRA data provides reliable and fairly disaggregated figures of public expenditure, audited by a central authority.
The research team at the Revitalizing Rainfed Agricultural Network (RRAN) has scraped and processed the CFRA data from 2005-06 to 2010-11 for all general and economic services to understand statewide public investments in agriculture and allied activities, and highlight the mismatch in investment and needs on the ground.
The processed data, along with detailed information for each head can be forked here.
Although the data is only available at the state level, it can provide valuable insight on not just public expenditure in other domains such as urban development, health, central and state sponsored schemes, but also highlight the differences in budget allocation and actual spending of various government heads.
Revitalizing Rainfed Agricultural Network (RRAN) has practice and policy node that generates ground based evidence and block, district and state level for policy engagement, the research node’s objective is to generate evidence for testing key hypotheses to enable an articulation of the nature and magnitude of public support needed to fuel growth of India’s rainfed agriculture. To facilitate this, a Data Center has been set up with the aim of acquiring, reconciling, processing, visualizing and disseminating pan India datasets to assist in exploratory analysis and develop research hypothesis, backing up policy advocacy through scientifically rigorous data analysis, and implementing data-driven decision-making tools for program implementation by grass-roots level organizations.

They ended up experiencing the full cycle of building a supervised learning task and got to predict cool things at the end of the session.This is a call for volunteers to mentor these kids and help them appreciate the nuances of the exercise.It's quite simple - requires you to be curious and have a passion for communicating ideas with a preferable exposure to MS Excel.The camp is for 5 hours this weekend - 11 October in Pune.We managed to find great mentors from datameet for our Bangalore camp. We hope we'll see you over for this one!You can read more about the mentor experiences here - http://www.datasciencekids.org/search/label/mentor%20storiesYou can read about the camp here - http://datasciencekids.org/Write to shashank...@aspiringminds.com to be a part of this camp.

It it's unicode, then copy-pasting gives us unicode text only, but inaccurate. It's possible that someone might have made a converter for this; if not, then if you have enough content then you could make your own converter.If the PDF has Unicode font in it, then my method fails.I wasn't aware of the stackoverflow questions you've linked to. Great insights here into why Unicode extraction is failing.If it's less pages then this free online multi-language OCR tool might help: http://www.i2ocr.com/free-online-hindi-ocr(per page time-taking process, so only advisable if content is less or if you have a slave army of interns at your disposal :P)--Cheers,Nikhil+91-966-583-1250Pune, IndiaSelf-designed learner at Swaraj University <http://www.swarajuniversity.org>http://nikhilsheth.blogspot.in

sorry for the delay, I was travelling for the past weeks. I have worked
extensively with the electoral rolls, and ultimately the only solution I
found for the problem of corrupted text is OCR - tesseract was the most
accurate in my experiments (and the relatively fastest...). It can also
be automated, though scaling up would require vast resources.

Let us know if you find an alternative (though I am sceptical),

Best,

I had the best results with a python tool called pdf-table-extract:

https://github.com/ashima/pdf-table-extract

you have to tweak the parameters a bit, but then it rather nicely
extracts the coordinates of each cell (defined as something surrounded
by a black rectangle) which you can then feed into ghostscript or some
such to extract the image (gs is faster than pdftoppm IMHO). In most
cases pdf-table-extract -i FILE -p PAGE -r 300 -l 0.7 -t cells_xml
worked nicely for electoral rolls...

Just my 5 cents,

Raphael

Dear Colleagues

The Bailey Bridge Initiative
            (BBI) of the Socio-Ecological Stewardship Programme (SESP)
            under the Director’s Office, Tata Institute of Social
            Sciences (TISS) has been designed to holistically integrate
            the scientific and technological tools and techniques along
            with Social Science interventions to create a ‘bridge of
            possibilities’ for students and practitioners for learning
            and application in their own field interventions to notice
            patterns, solve problems and shift systems and culture.
CDSA-BBI
              Workshop
A workshop, for 2 weeks from 9
            - 22 October, 2015 to be conducted on ‘Agency
                praxis and critical cartography for field interventions’
            based on cutting edge leadership praxis
            integrated along with advanced mapping tools
                and techniques for interventions in
            societies and communities. The workshop will be conducted at
            TISS, Mumbai in association with and supported by the Centre
            for Disability Studies and Action (CDSA), School of Social
            Work, and the Socio-Ecological Stewardship Programme,
            Director’s Office. This workshop in October, 2015 is the
            third of the series of workshops under the Bailey Bridge
            Initiative of the Socio-Ecological Stewardship Programme of
            TISS.
Purpose: The
            purpose of the Bailey Bridge Initiative, including the
            CDSA-BBI October workshop, is to foster agency among
            interested individuals and the communities they are engaging
            with. In this workshop of October 2015 the participants will
            be trained and equipped with the modern and relevant science
            and technological tools and techniques for informed decision
            making and social interventions.
Objectives of the
              CDSA-BBI workshop
At the end of the summer
            school, the participants will be able to:
(a) foster agency of oneself
            and the communities they are engaged with for informed
            decision making, action and results in solving problems and
            shifting systems.
(b) demystify science and
            technological concepts, tools and techniques of mapping for
            access and utilisation of resources; and to further learn
            how to share and scale concepts, tools and techniques in
            society and communities;
(c) learn and apply the
            mapping tools and techniques for interventions in the field;
(d) design for solving
            problems, shifting systems and culture using the Spectral
            Framework for Agency Building (SFAB)
(e) integrate mapping tools
            and techniques with Participatory Learning in Action (PLA)
            processes, in order to approach field-level issues
            holistically;
(f) stimulate spatio-visual
            and pattern thinking abilities for themselves and the
            communities they work with;
(g) design strategies and
            interventions along with community members while also
            building upon their knowledge systems;
(h) support communities to
            build and own the archives of information and knowledge for
            continuity and action;
You are invited to
              participate in this innovative initiative. The feedback
              from the participants in the earlier workshops is
              extremely encouraging. They felt the agency praxis
              integrated with mapping tools and techniques are going to
              significantly enhance themselves and their work in the
              field.

You would need to have Python installed on your system. (Linux /Mac/ windows)
After that , you would need to download the code repository available at the link.  (There is an option to download as zip file) 
This is the download link:
https://github.com/zerolevel/Locations/archive/master.zip
Unzip the file and then run python in the folder where you have unzipped the folder.. 
Then type:
python
This will open a prompt and then input the code

import Locations as LC 
lc_i = LC.Location() 
mum_cord = lc_i.getCoordinates(""Mumbai"")




I hope that should whet your appetite!

backend/dashboard/server.

I want to make a direct connection between our inputs (forms filled on
mobile phones) and the output (a map showing the collected data, and
maybe some data visualizations and tables). For that, one crucial link
in the chain is evading me. Need help from people who might already
know something about this. Please see this question on stackoverflow
and see if you can help:

-----

For those interested in exploring possibilities to reduce data entry
headache in field surveys and even capture precise locations, photos
and audio in your surveys, you can get started by going on
http://ona.io , create an account, and read whatever comes on screen.
It's deceptively simple.

And if your org has a decent budget, there's a great bunch of people
offering to do this with much more features, with many social sector
projects already under the belt. Check out http://dhwaniris.com/

I'm afraid that something like this doesn't really exist. There are several commercial solutions which will do this, but they don't come cheap.If on the other hand, you are willing to get your hands dirty, then this is very simple to do with something like ODK Aggregate. I had done this for an organisation in my previous job.You need to setup ODK Aggregate with a postgres/mysql database, and you should push your data to this instance of ODK Aggregate. This data will be written to a set of tables, and then the only missing link is to write up a service which will Query this Database, and return your data back as JSON.Let me know if you require any further details.Regards,Dev

Link to relevant article: http://craigappl.github.io/Decisions-Decisions/In its predecessor, formhub.org , there is a ""bamboo.io"" integrating button which generates a URL for me.Proof-in-pudding : Please click this linkSee some JSON there? The sources for it, are:Form (go ahead, fill it!)Form dashboardTo access this form from the ODK collect app on mobile, Hit Options > General Settings > Configure Platform Settings > URL : set to http://www.formhub.org/nikhilvj>> and then you can fill the form from the mobile.Go ahead and fill the form, either from web or from ODK Collect app (do remember to Send Finalized Forms so it's sent to server). You'll instantly see your submitted data collect, in JSON format, here.I can import that (getJSON) into my javascript, and do my funky stuff with it.So here I do have a  free, hosted solution that handles the process from data collection to aggregation, and gives me everything in one JSON feed at a handy set URL. Which I will then process at my own end to do my mapping, visualization, etc.The trouble comes with this : formhub.org isn't being maintained anymore; the people who created it aren't bothering to upgrade the servers to be able to handle more users & data. It's retiring. Already at certain hours when I go to the site, it doesn't load and I have to reload a couple of times (annoying!). The people who worked on it have now started ona.io as its clone and successor. So I moved there.. everything loads much faster there. If my field survey includes photos, audio and video then I'm certainly not going to risk working on formhub.org.The only thing the wonderful ona.io guys left out is the easy bamboo.io integration that formhub.org had. So I'm not having a handy URL of a latest JSON feed for my forms on ona.io . That's the missing link (literally!). There IS functionality provided (REST service as well as API), but I'm at sea regarding exactly what to do to make things work here.. the documentations seem to be made for people who have some Linux or SSH terminal operating. I only have an HTML page and FileZillaFTP. . Really appreciated the direct no-torture linkage that formhub.org was giving. Looking for guidance on what to do, or any alternative path, to achieve the same ease-of-business here on ona.io which in all other aspects is meeting my needs perfectly. (There are many ways described, but presently beyond my understanding levels)So, stackoverflow question : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32631442/bamboo-io-integration-with-xlsform-hosted-on-ona-io-like-formhub-was-providing/* end of gory details */--Cheers,Nikhil+91-966-583-1250Pune, IndiaSelf-designed learner at Swaraj University <http://www.swarajuniversity.org>http://nikhilsheth.blogspot.in

400,Nikhil VJ,#topic/datameet/feS4usMiX-U,5,2015-09-18 07:21:00,Re: [datameet] Looking for a missing link in mobile based field survey data visualization / analysis,"Hi Friends,

So after taking one more shot at ona.io's API, I found the missing link:

This is where I can start:
https://ona.io/api/v1/data?owner=nikhilvj

This gave me the URLs to all my forms' collected data.

https://ona.io/api/v1/data/81012

This is giving me the live collecting data for one of my forms.
(Live as in I press Refresh and it's refreshed with the latest. I have
simple needs, ra)

https://ona.io/api/v1/data/81012?format=json
This is my data in JSON format.

So YAY! I now have a JSON source that I can do funky things with while
our team collects data on the streets :)

Insight : I think open source programmers could use some guidance on
how to communicate about their work in a way that the people who will
apply their creation, can understand. In ona.io's case, all they
needed to say was:

Start by going here:
https://ona.io/api/v1/data?owner=[your usename]
>> That's it! :P


@Maroof, thanks for the heads up! Had seen that too, but self-hosted
servers simply don't fit the use case scenario.

And I think same would be true for any social sector org out there
that just wants a simple substitute to collecting data on paper.
Seriously, we can do things quite simply.

I'm going to lay out what works, and no, it's not the proper way. But
it works, and it's about as difficult as setting up a facebook
account.

## GETTING STARTED WITH MOBILE BASED FIELD SURVEYS, FOR DUMMIES ##

1. Go to http://ona.io and sign up, create an account.

2. Start by duplicating existing stuff. Go to https://ona.io/forms/,
search for ""nikhil"", grab one of those excels.

3. Login on http://ona.io, upload one of the excels which is an XLSForm.

4. On your phone, install ODK Collect :
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android

5. On your profile / dashboard at ona.io (ie, the first place you see
after logging in), read and follow the instructions at the bottom to
hook your ODK Collect app with your stuff. Basically it's about
setting the server as https://ona.io/[your usename]

6. in ODK Collect app, ""Get Blank Form"", you'll see the form you
uploaded in step 3.

7. Now ""Fill Blank Form"", fill it up, and after completion, ""Send
Finalized Form""

8. From the computer, on your dashboard, https://ona.io/[your
usename], you'll see the form has gotten an entry. You can see the
data in a table, if you geo-tagged it then you can see it on a map.
You can even see any photo you submitted in the form.

9. To use the data collected in your own programming, like a map or a
data visualization, go to this URL :
https://ona.io/api/v1/data?owner=[your usename]
..and follow your way through. (you might need to set the form's data
as public by going into the form's profile page)

10. And then many things you can do depending on how you want to apply
the data. HERE you would need a programmer who understands Javascript,
JSON and HTML. Till this point, you didn't really need any
programmer.. it was all point and click.

11. Open up the excels you downloaded, understand the way it's
structured, look up on http://xlsform.org/ for full documentation, and
reverse-engineer it to create your own surveys.

I am the co-founder of KarmaCompany (now called KarmaCorps - see www.karmacompany.org), a trust established to support through facilitation and seed funding nonprofit programs established by other organisations, and sometimes our own, across a range of sectors including the environment, education, livelihoods and health. Sensors Without Borders (SWB) (see www.sensorswithoutborders.org) is KarmaCorp's first environment-focussed initiative that has been established to use and provide open source technologies to measure environmental pollution particularly in regards air and water quality. We will make our sensor hardware, sensor calibration and maintenance procedures, and our data reporting platform (along with raw captured sensor data) all completely open source for use by advocacy organisations, research and development institutions, concerned individuals coalescing around citizen science initiatives, and perhaps even regulatory organisations.    In line with this, and given the nascent sensor landscape in India, SWB is organising its first Sensor Unconference at Workbench Projects (located at Halasuru Metro, Bangalore) on Sep 26th. If you wish to present on your own sensor-related work or even better demo your product, or would rather simply participate, please RSVP by Sep 22nd at sri...@karmacompany.org. If you wish to present / demo, you will need to send us a short abstract by the same date. Attendance is on the house either way.  See the attached invitation for further details.

The data has been collected by Janaagraha through RTI. It is maintained by the chief finance officer of BBMP. We received the responses in PDF format which was digitized at our expense. 
We believe lot of interesting analytics is possible on this dataset. It has geographic dimension (wards, zones) as well as a time dimension (5 years). This data represents spending of public money so in the interest of transparency we would like all Bangalore citizens to analyze it,Â  especially with reference to their own neighborhood/ward.
I hope this is interesting data for the Datameet community to look at. Though I'm using the term 'contest' along the lines of Kaggle contests,Â  it is more to do with sharing the data with interested individuals.

I have found this wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_India That lists them as:1)zone (**Not sure if people refer to these)2)states and union territories3)regions (**Not sure if people refer to these)4)divisions5)districts6)subdistricts7)blocks, hobils, villages, etc8)potentially neighborhoodsSo my question is this, if you are from India, how do you refer to location? Do you say ""I am from this village, this sub-district,this district,and this state/ union territories""?or is it more common for people to refer to sub-district, district, and state?I would think people would say they are from a specific village, then build up the name with sub-district, district, and state.But I am not sure.Could anyone help?Thanks!"

They have an office in Jodhpur, Hyderabad, and New Delhi, might be worth a meeting between them and some people on the group.They attended an open data camp a few years ago.  I have their contact if anyone is interested in getting a few people together and having a meeting.

Then when they select the town (internally marked as urban) present an additional dropdown for ward.2. keep separate tables for towns and villages and present urban/rural checkbox at the sub-district level and then choose which data to put in the dropdown based on whether user checks urban.I prefer 1, but am struggling with names and data.

A mini-debconf (regional event about debian) is being organized by me
and people from the local debian community on 12th and 13th September
2015. You could find some more information at

http://in2015.mini.debconf.org/

And about debian GNU/Linux distribution at :-

www.debian.org

We are looking for sponsors as well as people who would like to share
their data ideas, implementations under the free software and open
data model.

We are looking for sponsors, while at the same time we have started
marketing the event at some colleges and schools.

We have already invited Nikhil for the event as the idea/problem he is
grappling is (public transport in Pune) is especially relevant to one
and all . I, also exclusively use public transport and ride-shares
where it is possible so if any improvement happens for public
transport, me along with millions of commuters will be the
beneficiaries of it.

Because of shortage of funds, we are unable to invite people from
outside Pune but are considering Video-conferencing and other ways in
which ideas and implementations can be shared but only if they fit
under the free software and open data model and do have some copyleft
license to back it up as well.

In case, there are some potential sponsors, please mail me off-list
and we would be glad if you are able to sponsor individuals or/and
teams who are and might be doing awesome work using FOSS data models.

Look forward to your participation in the event. Please e-mail me if
you have any further queries.

Hack your visions :)

It is an open-platform platform not restricted to free software but
encompassing all that has to do with freedom though using copyleft
licenses .  The CFP is open till 30th August 2015 . Missed that in the
initial mail, sorry.

So let's say you have an idea or a project which uses as well as
shares FOSS ideals, we would welcome it. The audience is usually 2nd
and third year engineering students from various colleges, but we are
also trying to broaden it to schools and various groups who could use
it as a platform to share the idea and broaden the idea of free
software.

A simple example would probably make it more understandable. For
instance, let's see if your project uses openstreetmap and especially
all and any of the layers and you are looking to either extract or add
more data to it or do any whiz-bang simulations out of it, you would
be the perfect person/partner for the project.

But be aware that it's not just the use but also that the end-result
of the work would be available under public archives under a copyleft
license. Then it is a perfect candidate for the mini-debconf.

Similarly, any project which uses free software extensively and the
end-result of that project would be available in public archives under
a copyleft license, we would welcome such projects.

Hope the above clarifies and am able to share the data connect.

Great responses from many places (got many private replies from people
wanting to do this at their end too). Thanks for your interest!

One correction I'll make to my last email: Curating will happen, no
probs. It's the programming to do the visualization properly that's in
short supply right now and awaiting some of your magic touch :)

I'll share below some links that should open this up better for anyone
interested.

The Pune budget book's individual sections, separated and in CSV format:
http://nikhilvj.techydudes.net/files/data/csv201516/

Github Gist of the visualization I had made last year.. just download
zip from the right and you'll have all the involved files in one place
and can play around with them:
https://gist.github.com/answerquest/3c6bae2f00ff17ead99e

I did not find that form effective enough for the task at hand; found
another which seems perfect for our needs : Zoomable Treemap, with
boxes in boxes and ample room to write the numbers and longish titles
and references that are in my dataset. So I'm primarily looking for
how to achieve the programming and the right kind of input data format
for this:
http://bost.ocks.org/mike/treemap/

This link explained some things, but their method needed the data in a
form that I wasn't able to produce, and I had hit a dead end there.

split-up and not along real divisions which have a lot of unions and
overlaps of different codes, plus a lot of the info grouping multiple
items is there in lines that don't have any budget code entered and
can get lost)

It's human-readable and machine-non-readable.We need to reformat it to a machine-understandable standardized form which would then enable creation of apps, trip planners, GTFS feed, etc. I worked on such a format over the past few months, incorporating all the lessons we learnt in our initial encounters with the data (whose output you presently see on the pmpml.org website), and last month had proposed and gotten approval for such a format at a meeting with the new CMD. We even got some much appreciated data that had been prepared by ITDP in 2011. I then obtained a deport-wise breakup of the routes from the PMPML office. I then populated the 2011 data, split up depot-wise, into the standardized format. Below is the result of this exercise so far:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ppFJeb7Dnj6-1yvniH2Q6exQFzK6fM0wsZNn4XZIvkIA snapshot of some of the data so you can get an idea of the structures:..further down..This spreadsheet uses data validation to ensure that every stop entered is one that is existing in an adjoining ""stops"" master list, snapshot below:And here is the crucial gem : to have a proper bus routes database, you need to first have a standardized stops database, and all the routes must be built up from that stops database. ITDP's 2011 data had the stops properly standardized. In the spreadsheet, when you enter a new stop for a route, it does a Search-As-You-Type looking up this stops list and the user chooses the stop from the dropdown list.It works with both Marathi and English (If you want to enter in English, fill in the column next to this. Marathi cell takes precedence over English in case both are filled). Being able to work with both languages is crucially important here.You can try this out for yourself : go to the ""sandbox"" sheet and edit a route (just first tell me to add you to the spreadsheet editors list)So.. we're ready with the container, now we have to put in the updated data. I plan to show PMPML staff how to update this themselves, but right now there's a large quantity of data that needs filling in, and I was wondering if anybody would like to help out? We have received the latest data from PMPML (in the original human-readable but machine unreadable form). This is what it looks like originally:I'm converting the word file to excel and then the fonts to unicode marathi... here it is:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8sY5vZfk1W5N3RaZWxlbVpPRkkOf course, there would obviously be nothing better than a full-fledged high-tech routes management system for this.  I don't have the high-tech skills to make anything like that, but I was able to turn PMPML's verbally stated requirements into a technical design document with illustrations of what we need. You can see and download the design document here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FuLHS84uHuxQEsEquiWxcuiUdkv7Z8l29ImsYay5SHc (in the hopes that we might be able to find people who can help make this a reality). So the google spreadsheet is a low-tech substitute to at least get working with what we have till we get to such a system. Because it is standardized, follows a clear logical order and doesn't have random blank lines, formatting etc, a programmer could convert the data there to something he/she is comfortable working with, like XML, JSON, or if they get it right, even GTFS feed. I was able to use some excel formulae to generate a KML file of the routes of one depot. So this is essentially a middle-step that would reformat PMPML's data to a machine-readable plus human-readable and editable form that an app developer can then make use of. (Just FYI, GTFS format is NOT human-readable, so please don't expect anybody to go manually editing 6 lakh line long GTFS feeds, that's never going to happen. See an analysis here) I also have a clear goal to prioritize openness of data and ownership of PMPML (and by extension, commuters of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad) over the data : they should be able to edit it when they need to and the data should not get divorced away from them like it has happened the last few times. Keeping things as simple and usable as possible is priority, so if you can suggest ways to do more of that then it would be great.So inviting your involvement with this, in whichever form is most comfortable for you. You could even do this as an internship (we'll figure out certification formalities, don't worry) You could edit existing routes, fill in missing routes or stops, point out apocalypse-causing errors, get to work on making a sexy routes management system,Â  go to PMPML and train the staff there to populate this, etc etc. If you volunteer to edit information for a depot, I'll add you to the spreadsheet and selectively unlock that depot's sheet for you to edit. Or just share this email with groups who you think might be able to help. Please feel free to write back to me on nikh...@gmail.com if you have any queries.PS: Just to clarify, I'm not involved with the website of PMPML. I only volunteered to help with the bus routes data when there was a need to convert data in Shree-Dev font to Unicode Marathi.--Cheers,Nikhil+91-966-583-1250Pune, IndiaSelf-designed learner at Swaraj University <http://www.swarajuniversity.org>http://nikhilsheth.blogspot.in

Thanks for your replies. I have looked into using OSM as a source, but I need accurate temporal data. As OSM is user generated, changes to the map do not necessarily represent the actual date of construction. Changes are only recorded when a user notices a road has changed, and because PMGSY is a rural program, these road (most of which are under 1km) are often not recorded.
But maybe I'm missing something. I'll look into it again. Maybe I'll write a grant to hire some folks to go through these OSM files and match them to the 1+ lakh PMGSY projects.

Shirish needs a debian linux live usb to demo there for some session/training he's doing. he misplaced his copy somewhere and could not download a fresh one in time for the flight. So if anyone can help him out, then at midnight he's going to reach the Majestic bus terminus. Alternatively, someone else also going to the bar camp could meet him there. The location of the bar camp itself is away from the city, and i'm guessing downloading there won't be possible. So pls connect if u can.

549,Nikhil VJ,#topic/datameet/GXU5hUGPv1o,1,2015-07-03 22:20:00,[Pune] Crowdsourcing: Play match-the-following and help build Pune's bus route information data!,"Hi Friends,

Some of you whom I've put in Bcc had signed up on the Datameet Pune
interest form. While Craig is working on how to organize meetups
(found a venue, planning dates etc), I'd like to share a collaborative
task with you.

Here's something that some volunteer groups (ImproveMyCity, Pravasi
Manch, Pimpri-Chinchwad Citizens Forum) are upto. IMC is building a
website for PMPML (Pune's bus system), and we're helping PMPML put the
bus routes info in a standardized common structure that can then be
used for properly informing the public. We've had many roadblocks
previously with this process and are now much wiser off it.

There's an easy but repetitive task that we need to hammer out : we
have a standardized list of bus stops in English with unique code and
lat-long, which was formed and freely shared by an org called ITDP.
And we have a separate longer list of bus stop names in Marathi which
we'd gotten from an earlier unorganized dataset. We need to fill in
the Marathi counterparts of the English stop names.

I've put this all on this google spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ppFJeb7Dnj6-1yvniH2Q6exQFzK6fM0wsZNn4XZIvkI/edit?usp=sharing

There are just under 1800 stops to bilingual-ize this way.

So what you have to do:
Play match-the-following, or type some Marathi words in. Simple!
Please write back to me if you're interested in doing a set of rows
for half an hour or so today, and I will add you to the doc as an
editor.

Target completion time: Sunday 5th July EOD. But if you can give some
time today before 4pm that would be great, as we're meeting PMPML's
CMD at that time to discuss on all this. He's recently taken charge
and is very passionate about making all the information transparent
and accessible to the public.

--------------------------------------------

Why this is important :
If you see the routes sheets in the same google spreadsheet, we're
going to populate it with existing route info prepared by ITDP (a few
years old), and have PMPML staff edit and update the route information
using this core list of bus stops. When adding a new stop in a route,
it's got to be linked to other stop info like stopcode, lat-long.
Building up this way, with properly cross-linked information instead
of arbitrary entries, will then enable all the information management
features one needs from a modern public transport service.

Some background:
These exercises had been done in the past, but the technologies used,
the core data like this, etc wasn't properly shared or passed on, and
PMPML themselves weren't involved and so never had the standardized
stuff in their systems. A GTFS (that google maps uses) feed was
created, but that's basically not human-manageable.. the main datafile
is around 6 lakh lines long.

So now we want to do things differently. A very important component
here is OPEN data, and transparency at the input end. This data format
that we've commonly agreed upon is both human and machine readable,
and once set up, will be a lot easier to maintain. PMPML will have
constant direct access to the system and they will be able to edit the
data themselves as soon as there are changes from their end.

It would be great to have a full-on database-powered system.. I am
clueless on that but knew a few excel hacks so am doing it this way.
If YOU have the skills to drum something up then welcome aboard!

-------------------------------

Coming back, breaking it down to simple parts : The task for right now
is just to fill Marathi names for each bus stop.

OpenStreetMap is not accepting any bulk uploads, there is no point of making the dataset if it has to be redone again on osm. 
You can use iD to map the bus stops and provide the details along with the agency name. This is easy with a tool and also makes sense to contribute to osm.

Would be great to have you on board!

Yes, we really need a GTFS-ouputting system here.. it doesn't exist
yet so there's nothing at present to stick to.

Here's the PMPML data in GTFS format, latest copy that's from 2009 or
2011 or something:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8sY5vZfk1W5Z1dZa2dmTlY4aHc

The main data file in GTFS is around 6 lakh lines long for PMPML. That
too with all arbitrarily calculated trip times (to the last second :P)
that don't reflect reality. And for human purposes it's practically a
binary. It can't be updated; it needs to be over-written.

When you need to change a program, you need something that'll edit the
source code, not the binary. Unfortunately in PMPML's case we've only
inherited an old binary.

And that's exactly what we're trying to work on here : A system
that'll output GTFS. We need to bring PMPML's data upto a level of
standardisation that it becomes possible to create GTFS feed from it,
and yet it needs to remain linked to PMPML as an original,
self-sufficient structure that they can own, refer to, and edit any
time *by themselves*. What had happened so far was that the people
working on the GTFS completely de-linked it away, so PMPML themselves
no longer had any access to their own data. One huge factor in all
this was the translation from Marathi to English and deleting off of
all Marathi references. The original data was completely in Marathi.
The people maintaining the data are going to be doing so in Marathi.
So we had completely de-linked sets of data on the input and the
output side and that has been a major blocker. GTFS unfortunately
doesn't have a bilingual feature, so that's one place we're going to
have to go beyond it : any system that maintains the data must do so
in both languages.

And the past GTFS creation was done in a copyrighted way so there's no
way to get that system back now without coughing up another fortune.
That's not going to happen anytime soon as we're having a deliberate
underfunding of PMPML going on right now, with desperately needed
funds being diverted to 100 times more costly projects like metro.

If you know something that will work over the internet or without
needing installation, so that staff at PMPML can edit it, in Marathi
language, without needing to be engaged in a full-fledged contract
with an IT company, then please advise.

I've written notes on my analysis of GTFS format and how we could go
about this, here:
https://datameet.hackpad.com/Public-Transport-GTFS-Format-Analysis-soh7vdzRsW5


So if you can explore how to make a database of this and have a system
of creating, editing or dropping routes...
One core requirement here is what is referred to as ""child forms"" or
one-to-many relationship in forms. Basically, you fill in a stop on
the route. Then you click on an ""Add More"" button to add another stop.
Then you can drag the stops up and down to re-order them. So we need a
web-form system that enables that : Edit a route >> you get a listing
of the stops. You can add new stops or drop existing ones. Entry
should be in search-as-you-type mode.. and with google spreadsheet's
data validation I've got that feature. And the core data of course is
the stops; they'll be like the inventory / stocks list, and the routes
will simply be like different purchase orders or similar listings of
inventory items.

While I've seen this kind of feature at many places, I haven't been
able to find a way of using it here (been searching a lot!), and I'm
not a from-scratch PHP/SQL/.NET etc programmer. I know Javascript and
can work with XML and JSON, and with the excel format I've been able
to use formulas that render all the data in nested XML/JSON.

That's actually how the present pmpml.org site's system is working.. I
churned out a nested XML and the website team used it. Give the
website (www.pmpml.org) a try.. search for ""Pune Station"", and you'll
know why we need bus stop rationalisation ;) My role at present is in
helping to convert the data that PMPML has to a form that can be read
by a program AND be edited by a human (techies often miss the latter
part!). We're going with whatever's best suited, the administration is
co-operating fully, so hop on!

(sorry if this reply doesn't seem well-structured.. )

Hi Srinivas,

That would be great. But the list of stops we're using was created by
ITDP a couple of years ago. Some stops have shifted, plus when I
loaded it on to geojson.io, most of the locations seem to be off to
the east by 50-odd meters (instrument error probably). So the data
will need location updating. What's valuable is the rationalization of
bus stops with unique ID assigned to each, and the ITDP folks did a
fair amount of ground-truthing and filtered out many defunct stops,
added new ones, etc. That's why we're going with it. And even still,
there will be updates to do and I'm not sure if we can successfully
train the staff at PMPML to update on OSM regularly or to pull the
listings from there and update their data with it. It's good that the
lat-longs are there, but they're not critical at this point.

The system that evolves would decide whether linking with OSM is
doable or not. At present, what we have is a google spreadsheet.. can
you give a cell formula that retrieves the stops from OSM and lines
them up as search-as-you-type dropdown options when one is adding a
stop to a route? Or a script that pulls the data from OSM and formats
it in CSV with columns like the stops data we have at present, so that
we can copy in?

PS: Do share more advice, but kindly keep it clear that there are no
real coders on board at present who will be able to do what you're
suggesting. For example, when one says ""use OpenTripPlanner"", one
ought to give the actual *thing* that will do it, making adjustments
for all the requirements shared, with proper usage instructions, and
not leave it to the side having the requirements to figure it all out.
Or someone else in the community needs to do it and share it. This
isn't stackexchange (Hey I should go post something there too!). It
would be wonderful if more persons could just take the stuff that has
been shared open-source and implement the solutions that they think
should be used. I'm available for clarification on understanding the
data and the requirements, and if something awesome can come out from
this network then I'll see to it that there is official recognition
from the authorities for the efforts made. I'm actually working out
plans for a design contest that PMPML could announce for this.

Update on bus stops data: 100% Marathi-fication complete!
The spreadsheet is now ready for updating route info. Will go meet the
PMPML folks whenever I can in next week and start. User will be able
to add new or edit routes by filling in either Marathi or English name

July 2015   

 Dear Mr. Nikhil,
In this  edition, we present an update on the  inauguration of two Tender S.U.R.E roads in  Bangalore.  Also featured  are key highlights of the Smart Cities and AMRUT  missions launched by the Government of India recently.
We would love to hear from you. Please do write to us with your suggestions and feedback.
Regards,
Srikanth Viswanathan
Coordinator - Advocacy and Reforms










Tender S.U.R.E roads inaugurated in Bangalore 
On the 20th of June, the Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah inaugurated the St. Mark’s Road and Vittal Mallya Hospital Road in central Bangalore after their up-gradation as per Tender SURE standards. 

Tender SURE will make roads durable and ease pedestrian and traffic movements. Much of unnecessary road cuttings by various utility agencies will also be avoided. Both roads are up to five meters wide and are now equipped with parking and bus bays, LED street lights and cycle lanes. Twelve roads are now being developed under this project, post the two pilots. You can access the video coverage of the event here.





Centre unveils operational guidelines for Smart Cities challenge competition
The Smart Cities Mission was launched on the 25th of June, with an aim to create 100 smart cities in the next five years. An outlay of Rs 48,000 crores in Central grants has been earmarked for the project. According to the Mission’s operational guidelines, eligible cities will be chosen through a two-stage City Challenge competition. In Stage-1, each state and union territory will score their cities based on a set of criteria and nominate the top scorers (a total of 100 nominees) for Stage-2. These criteria awards points to cities based on their self-financing ability, their track record with implementing JNNURM projects and reforms, service delivery, internal resource 
generation and existing service levels. In Stage-2, these potential smart cities are required to submit a smart city plan which will undergo rigorous scrutiny. The cities will be evaluated on their current status and plan proposal 
i. 

AMRUT urban mission launched
AMRUT aims to cover 500 cities and towns, with a population of one lakh and above.

AMRUT is a 10-year mission with a total investment of about Rs 2 lakh crore. Under the scheme, states have the flexibility in designing schemes based on the needs of identified cities as well as in their execution and monitoring. States will only submit State Annual Action Plans to the Centre for broad concurrence based on which funds will be released. States are, thereafter, required to transfer funds to ULBs within 7 days of receipt of funds from Centre. 








Central assistance will cover 50 percent of project cost for cities and towns with a population of up to 10 lakh and one-third of the project cost for those with a population of above 10 lakh. Central assistance will be released in three instalments in the ratio of 20:40:40 based on achievement of milestones indicated in State Annual Action Plans. The  mission provides for incentivizing reforms by earmarking 10 percent of annual allocation to be allocated to good performers at the end of each year ii. 

Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana targets ‘Housing for All by 2022’ 
The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana  (PMAY) targets construction of two crore houses by 2022 for the urban poor, especially for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Lower Income Group (LIG). The scheme will provide a credit linked subsidy of  1 lakh to 2.3 lakh instead of actual fund transfers. States/UTs are required to mobilize the balance. PMAY will cost around Rs 3 lakh crore over the next seven years.  The Central subsidy has also increased from Rs 75,000 earlier to Rs 1 lakh to 2.30 lakh per house, depending on the specific scheme iii.

And then I thought it would be better to throw the challenge out in the open instead of locking-in dependency... if the bus authority is the one issuing the challenge then it'll probably carry through and get taken up seriously. Professors usually complain about not having meaty projects for their students' internships. So let's meet that demand.So right now this is how I envision a possible contest timeline (I'm thinking to much ahead but here it is anyway):1. Announcement with open sharing of data and design requirements (so really kicking it off with all resources made available)2. Taking in registrations from teams3. Forming an online community of all participating teams and airing out all doubts, clarifications etc there4. Setting periodic ""checkpoints"" of select features that each team must achieve and showcase or else be dropped from the competition. (like achieving map display, achieving stops-editing, on-map editing, GTFS conversion, etc)5. Final lap of 1 month to get everything together, and have to put up fully functional prototype loaded with data for public review by a set deadline.6. Some surprises that I don't want to reveal right now, they'll work only if kept secret.And here's how I'm thinking of bringing the aspects of collaboration in :Teams can contact each other and merge into one, with no roll-back possibility. This will be easily done IF we haven't kept any prize money that needs to be split. This could lead to, say, a joint solution created by 2 or 3 colleges working together.I don't care if it doesn't work out at the end.. something of this sort will produce something or the other that's useful. After all, when you want to hit a target, you need to fire a few degrees upward to account for gravity.What I've visualized in the ppt is basically a visualization of the needs that the folks at PMPML have been telling us again and again over the last few months. 2 weeks back the newly appointed CMD also told us that they desperately need this kind of thing, and so I decided to flesh out the requirements so we have something detailed to go with.This would happen at the output end of an ongoing effort to (finally!) standardize the data that they have, bringing it to a format that is both human and machine compatible (and PMPML-approved.. their consent and commitment is critical). So it's taking shape here, please see the ""swargate"" sheet:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ppFJeb7Dnj6-1yvniH2Q6exQFzK6fM0wsZNn4XZIvkIBase data prepared by an org named ITDP, this data is a few years old but is more recent that the GTFS file we have, and has had ground-truthing and stops rationalization done. So the plan is to populate this, and then guide the PMPML's transport managers through editing and updating it, and simultaneously we might launch the contest.

Hi all,
Was talking to some people and came up with few links which could be useful :-

https://mapzen.com/projects/valhalla
https://github.com/valhalla

https://transit.land/
https://github.com/transitland

http://transit.geotrellis.com/#!/travelshed
http://transit.geotrellis.com/travelshed.html
https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-transit

If anything, it tells that there are more than a few options besides GFTS.

But you need perfect GTFS files to use Geotrails. The issue is whether to adopt GTFS or not. Its more of creating these datasets is a time intensive task. Its very hard to explain this to a non programmer sometimes. What we need is a much more simpler solution to export to GTFS if pre recorded data exists. I would like anyone else to not occupy the thread with GTFS and use the existing hackpads.Regards,Srinivas Kodali"

Very systematic thinking. I have added some of my thoughts below. Not all of this is necessary in v1.0 of this Bus routes mgmt system, but thinking long term, these are features that i thought were important.Stop viewingLet users rate/comment on the state/quality of bus stop. Give the users the timings (departure/arrival) for their starting bus stop to the stop they want to go to (some bus maps i've seen only show what time the bus leaves from its depot so the user does not know what time it will reach his/her own stop) Maybe you could have an option for 'Leave now' or 'Leave later' like Google mapsRoute viewingLet users comment on the state/quality of the bus/driver/conductor. Something like the olacabs app. (only makes sense if more or less the same bus drives on the same route each day)Let users see a tab showing the expected and actual arrival times of the bus (on average, for different days of the week) sort of like what the irctc website has for trains. This could be enabled with an app that records bus passenger gps data. I have an irctc app that does the same when i'm on a trainRoute managementIf the system could somehow show live data for 'number of passengers' on each trip (based on ticket sales/avg distance travelled) that could form the basis for more responsive/flexible decision making on which routes need more frequent buses. It would also give insight into whether the use of buses in the city is increasing/decreasing, thereby giving policymakers incentive to improve the system (because metrics show concrete improvements)Besides the above points we could also have social media integration, so users can share any positive experiences.Also with this system the mobile app would be as important if not more important than the web interface, most internet traffic these days is mobile.I also had some thoughts on the discussion and proposal put forth by Adhiraj. As a separate initiative, it can very well be made the goal for a modelling exercise, seems like a problem that programmers could do well with. The goal would be optimizing the routes for 'time taken' and 'frequency' based on multiple inputs.RegardsCraigOn Tue, Jul 7, 2015 at 5:08 PM, Sarang Mahajan <sarangk...@gmail.com> wrote:Dear Nikhil,A similar exercise was conducted by Mumbai Environmental Social Network for the Bus route mapping of BEST buses.

And then I thought it would be better to throw the challenge out in the open instead of locking-in dependency... if the bus authority is the one issuing the challenge then it'll probably carry through and get taken up seriously. Professors usually complain about not having meaty projects for their students' internships. So let's meet that demand.So right now this is how I envision a possible contest timeline (I'm thinking to much ahead but here it is anyway):1. Announcement with open sharing of data and design requirements (so really kicking it off with all resources made available)2. Taking in registrations from teams3. Forming an online community of all participating teams and airing out all doubts, clarifications etc there4. Setting periodic ""checkpoints"" of select features that each team must achieve and showcase or else be dropped from the competition. (like achieving map display, achieving stops-editing, on-map editing, GTFS conversion, etc)5. Final lap of 1 month to get everything together, and have to put up fully functional prototype loaded with data for public review by a set deadline.6. Some surprises that I don't want to reveal right now, they'll work only if kept secret.And here's how I'm thinking of bringing the aspects of collaboration in :Teams can contact each other and merge into one, with no roll-back possibility. This will be easily done IF we haven't kept any prize money that needs to be split. This could lead to, say, a joint solution created by 2 or 3 colleges working together.I don't care if it doesn't work out at the end.. something of this sort will produce something or the other that's useful. After all, when you want to hit a target, you need to fire a few degrees upward to account for gravity.What I've visualized in the ppt is basically a visualization of the needs that the folks at PMPML have been telling us again and again over the last few months. 2 weeks back the newly appointed CMD also told us that they desperately need this kind of thing, and so I decided to flesh out the requirements so we have something detailed to go with.This would happen at the output end of an ongoing effort to (finally!) standardize the data that they have, bringing it to a format that is both human and machine compatible (and PMPML-approved.. their consent and commitment is critical). So it's taking shape here, please see the ""swargate"" sheet:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ppFJeb7Dnj6-1yvniH2Q6exQFzK6fM0wsZNn4XZIvkIBase data prepared by an org named ITDP, this data is a few years old but is more recent that the GTFS file we have, and has had ground-truthing and stops rationalization done. So the plan is to populate this, and then guide the PMPML's transport managers through editing and updating it, and simultaneously we might launch the contest.--Cheers,Nikhil+91-966-583-1250Pune, IndiaSelf-designed learner at Swaraj University <http://www.swarajuniversity.org>http://nikhilsheth.blogspot.in

We commuters really need something like this.... Badly... :( There are a few questions that come to my mind... - Are we looking at a system that would work on real time data or stand alone? Will the system get the real time updates of the buses? Where they are? At what time they reached a spot etc? It the system being designed considering this? or it is a tool which would help PMPML to plan their routes and have inventory of bus stops? I would like to be clear on what exactly we mean when we talk about 'Management', to what extent are we talking about managing the system? Once I am clear on these, will have more thought to share :)About the presentation....I see the presentation here has covered all the important aspects that should be looked at but I feel that its has not talked much about the 'Analysis and Statistics' part of it. I see a 'Analysis, Statistics' Tab present but there is nothing written about it. Can we/ should we give few ideas on what 'Analysis' should/ may include? If one is developing a 'Bus Route Management System' - Managing would require a set of data and the system would collate the data and good analysis support would 'improve' the functioning of the system.

Effective management of the system is effected by many other aspects other that route and stop management.... issues like: buses not stopping at designated stops, over occupied buses, bus breakdown frequency, driver/ TC behavior etc are also important.

---------- Forwarded message ----------From: Yatish Devadiga <devadig...@gmail.com>Date: Thu, Jul 2, 2015 at 8:29 PMSubject: 8 reasons why Good Governance will not come by building on AadhaarTo: 8 reasons why Good Governance will not come by building on AadhaarShared via http://www.moneylife.in/article/8-reasons-why-good-governance-will-not-come-by-building-on-aadhaar/42567.htmlPrime Minister Narendra Modi, the once upon a time staunch critic and opponent of Aadhaar numbering scheme, is not only enforcing, but also mandating usage of the UID number for his pet Digital India campaign  The Aadhaar is putting national security in jeopardy. It is destroying governance and ability to govern. It will end the rule of law and perhaps even compromise the sovereignty of India. It is facilitating money laundering. Here is a summary of why Prime Minister Narendra Modi must act on the concerns and on his election promises. 1 The Political Gimmick: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been amongst the strongest critics of the unique identification (UID) or Aadhaar, recognizing that it was running on mere executive order and not legislative sanction, he had called it a political gimmick. He had further highlighted that neither the team that met him, nor the then Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh had been able to allay his concerns and fears about National Security over the UID. 2 The Purpose of UID: In the presence of over a dozen different IDs, each of which serves a purpose and is not replaceable, there is no purpose served by the UID. When issued based on already existing IDs it is only adding yet another layer of red tape. When issued by “introducers” it serves no useful purpose, as it is not subject to any audit or verification.  3 The Validity of UID: Furthermore, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and the Finance Ministry have admitted that there are no designated officials certifying the identity or address and as such the UID is neither proof of address (PoA) nor proof of identity (PoI). From the procedure announced by the UIDAI, to recover lost UID numbers it is evident that several records are returned for biometric and demographic information. It is required to narrow match to 5-10 entries. This also means that de-duplication using biometrics is a mere theoretical exercise and biometrics cannot produce a unique ID. The UIDAI and Ministry of Finance have both indicated that no verification or audit of the UID database has ever happened. The UID is merely a random number assigned by the UIDAI to unverified and unaudited data submitted by private parties paid for each record is therefore not even a proof of the existence of any person. 4 The Insurance of UID: In addition, biometrics are neither permanent nor immovable. Biometrics change during the life of a person, sometimes even within a year, without warning. Biometrics can be easily stolen, replicated or misused as has been demonstrated by hacking fingerprints, and iris scans of high profile targets. The enrollment agencies that have captured the biometric have the entire demographic and biometric database in their possession and as such it can be misused or stolen. Once the biometric fails or is stolen, all the functions that have crept to link access to the biometric are denied with little or no recourse to the victim. 5 The Security Risks of UID: Using the UID to establish other ID’s and claim rights as a citizen when the UID is not even a PoI, PoA or PoE or can even be stolen creates a perfect channel for identity theft and infiltration by terrorists, anti-nationals, organized criminals and illegal immigrants. It is therefore not only a threat to national security but also to the sovereignty of the country. Using the UID as the sole or electronic know your customer (KYC) to open bank accounts that have no restriction of anti-money laundering rules, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s Master Circular on KYC, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Basel Standards of keeping customer data, as has been forced by the Department of Revenue and the UIDAI on the RBI, is opening doors for use of such accounts to finance terrorism, organized crime, park black money, siphon direct cash transfers of subsidy and launder money. There are enough incidents in the country that highlight the compromise of national security through UID. 6 The Sufficiency of UID: Further, the UID is neither necessary nor sufficient to deliver any benefit, rights and entitlements. Each benefit, right or entitlement requires its own ID and information that can neither be captured by the UID nor was the UID ever needed to deliver these. The UID worsens the quality of the ID databases by eliminating genuine beneficiaries and adding fake beneficiaries as for example has been seen in Pondicherry. The use of UID adds a new layer to the business processes creating exclusion and increasing untraceable leakages. Any leakages can be plugged by audit of the original ID databases without requiring a UID. Further process redesign to reduce steps, increase auditability reduces leakages. Neither of these has been done.  7 The Costs of UID: The UID adds cost to every business process that uses it to deliver any benefit, right or entitlement. There is no basis to show any savings effected by the use of the UID as such savings can only happen by denying the delivery of benefits, subsidies or entitlements by claiming those denied were fake entries in the ID database of the government department. Firstly there can be no claim of the UID database being free of fraudulent entries. Secondly there are no FIRs in any department against officials or fake individuals. Thirdly many genuine beneficiaries have been excluded by the use of the UID. The UID therefore has only costs, not savings. Furthermore no cost has been put to stolen identity or worse the theft of a part or the entire registry.  8 The Disenfranchising by UID: A multi billion pound National ID program was scrapped by UK Prime Minister David Cameroon as part of his election promise even after the citizens had paid for their IDs for similar reasons that promised to disenfranchise the citizens and make them helpless if such an ID did not work. The US government post 9/11 under Bush had already discovered the use of Social Security Number (SSN) had resulted in identity theft of massive proportions and had issued explicit memos to all offices about ""Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information”. This also required restricting the use of the SSN and delinking the SSN from multiple usage. What the Prime Minister must do?Stop the UID linkages to government programs and initiate delinking UID from all government databases.Verify and audit the entire UID database; if it is too expensive to do so, destroy the database as was done in the UK.Initiate a time-bound judicial probe by a retired CAG and Supreme Court Judge supported by the CBI to investigate the exposure of the country to serious threats to national security due to UID.Audit of other government databases can be done to ""clean"" them without requiring any new ID.  If an ID is desired or an easy method to deliver and audit benefits is desired, consider shared ID http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/time-to-think-of-aadhaars-alternatives or benefit delivery described here http://www.moneylife.in/article/10-digital-solutions-to-make-india-the-best-governed-nation/38338.html. (Dr Anupam Saraph is a Professor, Future Designer, former governance and IT advisor to Goa’s former Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar and the Global Agenda Councils of the World Economic Forum.)

Hi all,
Dear @Amiruddin the issues that have been outlined are just tip of the
iceberg. There are some other reasons as well :-

a. The company to which the project has been given is not Indian (it's
an American company) . Would such a company would have loyalty to us
or someone else ?

b. Also it's not the question of the white man or the black man but
data corruption. There has been no sharing by the company concerned
what toolings are they using ?

Even a simple wikipedia page outlines the issue with data corruption
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption gives the various ways
in which silent data corruption can happen.

c. Are there any penalty laws if data gets corrupted. AFAIK there
aren't. Then there should be auditing by third-party of random data
(chunks) , is there some sort of known genuine third-party auditors
that the majority will accept and are technically skilled to see it
through, apart form the Election Commission which does it every 4-5
years don't think so as the dataset is just so huge.

Also how are you assuming that the middle-man will be out?  AFAIK the
application itself is proprietary. If I were a bad guy/ an actor I
would just code a back-door and nobody would be wiser and this could
be anybody in a chain who is supposed to verify the Aadhar information
to the one who is filling the data in. There were reports of data
leakage right at the input source which had been deliberately ignored.
Forget elsewhere, there were such incidents happening in Pune itself
which came in newspapers for a day or two and then disappeared. As
shared above as well, in neither of the cases was any FIR filed or
anything else for that matter.

And if the govt. were really serious about getting people social
welfare, the bank account initiative + using the post office as a
multi-user institution would be more useful.

At the end of the day, whether it is the ration card or Aadhar card,
you will be dealing with the same person whom you were dealing on day
1.

You are also assuming that data at the input stage is all correct, I
had looked at couple of places where people who were working at
Aadhar, how much training they had ?  And if data is corrupted at the
source itself (during sign up) then don't think people will come to
know unless something obvious like gender has changed or year has aged
etc.

I don't really want to talk about Aadhar much  as it's a slippery
slope, hence signing off for now.
Till later.

The biggest problem is that, nobody knows the whole story, every person who is
screaming has read part of somebody else's perception and making his or her own
perceptions.

I was present at the talk in the above link. I think the engineering team has
done a good job at putting in place a robust system in place.

Dear Mohit,
I know that quite a few indian organizations are also part of it but
at the start at least it was Accenture and L1 Identity Solutions, now
Sagem Morpho who are/were part of it. At least Sagem still is.

http://www.moneylife.in/article/unfolding-aadhaar-scam-important-pages-missing-from-uidai-contracts---part1/39321.html

http://www.moneylife.in/article/unfolding-of-aadhaar-scam-guaranteed-revenue-flow-for-mncs-by-modi-govt-ndashpart2/39333.html

And to see that at least the Sagem part is true is their own hackathon
which they organized just sometime back.

https://www.hackerearth.com/sprints/aadhaar-application-hackathon/

My simple question is, should a foreign company have such sort of data
which could be used to influence everything and anything they want out
of it and be paid on top of it.

While http://www.moneylife.in/life/uid/aadhaar has enough questions on
different methods, for e.g. see
http://www.moneylife.in/article/retrieving-lost-aadhaar-number-impossible-test-for-the-poor/40583.html

At the very least, Aadhar or UIDAI has done a piss-poor job of sharing
how they would make the data secure as well as getting data retrieved.

misinterpretations happening, including a tables-turning on UIDAI
itself :

https://in.news.yahoo.com/three-supreme-court-orders-later--what-s-the-deal-with-aadhaar-094316180.html
Three Supreme Court Orders Later, What's the Deal with Aadhaar?
""By law, you should not be denied any government service in India if
you don’t have an Aadhar card number. So why do various government
programs continue to ignore three Supreme Court orders and insist on
the dreaded number, and how are they getting away with it?""

One clear disadvantage I see of the biology subject being totally
separated from engineering fields : The fact that fingerprints change,
can be easily faked, and cannot be used as identifier is being
absolutely ignored by every UID advocate :P


I think the issue here is at a deeper level than the ""techie"" domain,
and I think allowing fear to rule our lives and make our decisions for
us pushes us more and more into the kind of mentality that favours
such ideas. One of the first governments in history to really go
all-out in keeping track of each and every citizen, was Nazi Germany.
We cannot separate the intent from the technical aspects. Every
technology-advocate has a moral responsibility to ensure that the
thing he's advocating doesn't get used in the worst interests of the
public. It is either absent-minded or fraudulent to ignore the abuses
and focus only on promised advantages that have already been proven to
be false in other countries that have been over this hill already, as
the articles shared have illustrated.

And keep in mind the Precautionary Principle : If something unnatural,
invasive and potentially harmful is being proposed, then the burden of
evidence lies on the proposers, to prove its safety, failing which it
can automatically be presumed to be unsafe. Cars without safety
certificate are automatically dangerous.. we don't need an unsafety
certificate to prove that. Let's compare the smoking ban concept with
this : Suppose we ban universal tracking of citizens, as some
countries like UK have. Now that can be compared with banning smoking!

Besides, the world is not going to die if universal tracking doesn't
happen. Nature never considered it a good idea to keep track of every
animal or plant : something every species-cataloger will complain
about. Yet fulfilling everyone's needs was somehow managed. On the
other hand, if universal tracking does happen successfully, then
honour killings, harassments, pre-judgements, blackmail, loss of
autonomy, further rigidity etc in a deeply corrupt, unequal, biased
and unfair society will become SO much easier...

On OSM they can. Legally, people aren't allowed to use prints or high-res images from google maps in their work.. on OSM there's no such restriction. And, OSM has its data in vector format, which makes it possible for anyone to style maps in their own way, and even go totally creative with it. The default OpenStreetMap might seem a bit too ugly, but look at a few of its various flavours:http://nikhilvj.techydudes.net/files/leaflet-layers.html (go to layers button on top right)So it's pretty much spawned a revolution in mapping, quite similar to what Wikipedia did for encyclopedias.All the mapping technologies I'm working on are possible because of 
this non-copyrighted, wikipedia-like user-generated map of the 
world. The fact that it's all being done on a shoestring budget while its only counterpart must be spending many times that, is pretty amazing.Note: It seems taking money in INR isn't possible for them. It's UK-based, so best to get a contact of yours in UK/Europe to chip in.Regards,Nikhil, India

For the district assignments post-delimitation, I processed the final release from the Delimitation Commission's website -- pay special attention to the date of the final order and to those handful of states (Assam, JK, Manipur, etc.)  where the delimitation process was suspended. That is, I can match the ACs to districts for all election post-delimitation. Now I need do the same for the pre-delimitation elections. I understand that this is more complicated given the fact that many new districts and that a handful of states have been created since 1976. However, currently I am only concerned with the election that have occurred from 2000 - 2013, which removes the new state problem, and I am using the districts as-they-were in 2000, which helps eliminate the new district problem -- I can identify the where/which parent district the AC was part of. OK my problem: I cannot seem to find a reliable source for the pre-delimitation elections. That is, I cannot find a usable list that identifies the district an AC belongs to nor can I find a machine-readable delimitation pdf that will allow me to do this. The shp file here http://www.dartmouth.edu/~sandip/data.html is promising, but after a close examination, it does not seem to be accurate -- many ACs are missing district matches and a handful are incorrectly matched.   Does anyone have this list -- a list of pre-delimitation ACs matched to the district they fall in? "

That platform is perfect for cleaning up the polling booth data, and we can really make an amazing open data contribution here.. we could also organize synchronized hackathons around this, add cleaned up data into OSM, etc. Can somebody who understands the code please help to get this started?I'm attaching one possible input file. It's my assembly constituency ( Pune(34) > Parvati(212) ). There is a unique 'id' column that is a concatenation of PC, AC, polling booth number and booth name. (we need the name to be displayed up front as some contributors will know that school and will bring all its booths to the right place). And also a kml having the boundary of the constituency. (rough, scraped from ECI, please share if you have any other source.. the one from http://dx.doi.org/10.4119/unibi/2674065 came out totally weird after converting from shp to geojson).Links:Pincode project : http://pincode.datameet.org/Dataset: http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/data/2674065--Cheers,Nikhil+91-966-583-1250Pune, IndiaSelf-designed learner at Swaraj University <http://www.swarajuniversity.org>http://nikhilsheth.blogspot.in

Crowdcrafting.org seems pretty good!
I'm afraid the coding part over there is a little out of my league at
present. I saw their sample geocoding application, and noticed that it
was about users inputting geolocation afresh. I'm sure it's there in
the code, but I couldn't understand how one could get it to show
present location and verify / edit that, like what the pincode project
does.

It would actually make so much sense to have a generic application for
crowd-correcting any mapping file. I've written up a
requirements/design doc here :

I work with CrowdANALYTIX – a community of data
experts & scientists providing analytics services. 
 
If you work at a Non-profit or University, you can host a Learning Contest with us for free. We've just hit ~8,000+ data experts on our
platform - and the community has helped solve a variety of problems across domains such as life sciences, telecom, government, etc. 
 
The main difference: instead of prize money,
all content generated (reports, algorithms etc.) will be made available to the community afterwards, so they can build upon, learn new skills and develop even
better solutions. The contest requests will be prioritized to ensure we can provide the most impact.
 
Do let me know if you are interested – and I can send over the details. Look forward
to hear from you and hoping that we can help you with your data science
problems. 
 
If you have any further questions
/ thoughts do reach out.
 
Sincerely,
-Amit.

OpenBMap


It's similar to Google's location services or Mozilla's
          location service, but free.  You can make use of it as a location
            provider in Android using the OpenBMap plugin for microG
          unified NLP.  And you can contribute data as well using the Radiobeacon

          but could be a real powerhouse with a little extra effort.

You have not heard from us for much too long. This is the translatewiki.net email newsletter for May 2015.

Translation Rally from May 16 to May 25
This first Translation Rally of 2015 is imminent. It starts on May 
16, 2015 20:00 UTC and will run until May 25, 2015 00:00 UTC. This rally
 is sponsored by Wikimedia Sverige, the Swedish Wikimedia Chapter and Internetfonden. We are very grateful for their support! Check out the project page for more details.
Thank you for your continued support for translatewiki.net and 
the projects it supports. The success of open source software 
localisation relies on your continued involvement and enthusiasm. Please
 try and dedicate 15 minutes a week â preferably do more and bring your 
friends! â to updating and reviewing translations for your favourite 
project.
If you are a developer of a promising Free or Open Source 
Software product and you are looking for a great community to localise 
your product, please get in touch with us. The same goes for those that 
wish to aid in developing the Translate extension further. We really 
need you as staff volunteer, as we are very keen to increase our staff 
capacity at the moment to support more projects and get support requests
 out of the way more quickly.
Finally, if you are not a translator yet, please register so you can be a localisation hero, too!
We welcome feedback about this newsletter. Please let us know by 
sending a reply to this mail. We will try to accommodate your wishes.

On behalf of the translatewiki.net staff,
Siebrand Mazeland


You are one of 9,000 people receiving this email because you have registered with https://translatewiki.net,
 the wiki localisation platform for translation communities, language 
communities, and free and open source projects. This newsletter will be 
sent at most once every month.
You can opt-out by visiting translatewiki.net
 while you are logged in, and checking the box ""Do not send me email 
newsletters"" at the bottom of the tab ""User profile"" in your preferences
 - although we hope you will not. If you have multiple accounts with the

Are you referring only to the buildings dataset in citySDK? If so I think its hard to find land records geo refrenced to each building for any Indian city. 
Few cities like new york, berlin have opened up their datasets in the past.
That apart, you can use buildings data mapped on openstreetmap. But you may not get all the details of the building.
There are people trying to adopt citySDK to Indian conditions. I work on transport related data.
If you want such data, census is the only possible source I can think of which might have buildings data.

Starting with just a lat/long, then allowing polygon specification?--Cheers,Nikhil+91-966-583-1250Pune, IndiaSelf-designed learner at Swaraj University <http://www.swarajuniversity.org>http://nikhilsheth.blogspot.in

NLRMP is one of the Mission Mode Programs under the National eGovernance Plan (NeGP), much like the MMP on Income Tax, Passport etc.The main agenda was to move to a conclusive Land Titling regime, and to have a conuntrywide cadastre. You can find the details at http://nlrmp.nic.in/ and at http://nlrmpportal.nic.in. NLRMP superseded the previous programmes for computerising land records.The project does have a component of mapping, and perhaps would have  
required a new land survey to be done to map the land details 
accurately. Since Land is a state subject, the onus is on the different state governments to implement this programme, and the progress has been varied. As far as I know, Andhra Pradesh (Bhu Bharati) was the first to come out with their new titling law and achieve some progress in the mission.Kind RegardsMahroof____________________________________________________________

I'd actually downloaded that set some months back and didn't know enough about mapping at the time, had hit some road-blocks and abandoned it. Now went back and was able to get through to what I wanted.I converted the shapefile for maharashtra's polling booths to geojson, at this site: http://converter.mygeodata.eu/The site has a CSV output option which gives everything except latitude-longitude ;)Then, not finding a non-crashing online place to process this file having 88k+ locations, I reverted back to command line and grep'd it down to pune-district level.grep ""\""district\"": 25,"" maharashtra.booth.json > district25.pune.booth.jsonThat brought it down to a workable 7099 locations, and now I could use this online json-to-csv converter (which works with geojson and outputs the lat-long):http://konklone.io/json/Finally having it in CSV (which both humans and machines can handle, yay). I loaded it to a leaflet app (https://github.com/perrygeo/leaflet-simple-csv). First observations: 1. The CSV has 7099 locations but the webpage says that 4968 have been loaded. Where the balance 2k+ went I can't say right now. Will need to filter the list further down to AC levels.2. My own polling booth isn't marked at its location. It is marked, alongwith 136 others, at the default location you get when you search for Pune.3. At many places in my locality, two different schools are marked at same location.There are disclaimers in the Bielefeld data about this.. so it's going to need work. So it would be a good exercise to get the data from another source (ECI).. and compare them. I have the AC-wise data of Pune from ECI, I'm now going to filter down the Bielefeld data to the same AC's, and then we can have two datasets to compare. First observations for my AC from there : One polling booth is in Nepal, two others are in the mountains, and a few are out of the AC's limits.PS: AC means Assembly Constituency."

Can we clone http://pincode.datameet.org/ for polling booths?

Sample CSV attached, which is extracted from the data that Raphael
shared. (I'm finding both this and ECI's current data equally
inaccurate at least for my area!)

We could combine the state, assembly constituency and booth number to
make a unique id for each booth, and then follow the same procedure as
pincode.datameet.org is following.

If someone can guide me on how to go about this, I'll be glad to take
it up, for Pune for starters. We have municipal elections in a year
and need to clean this stuff up.

Crowdcrafting.org seems pretty good!
I'm afraid the coding part over there is a little out of my league at
present. I saw their sample geocoding application, and noticed that it
was about users inputting geolocation afresh. I'm sure it's there in
the code, but I couldn't understand how one could get it to show
present location and verify / edit that, like what the pincode project
does.

It would actually make so much sense to have a generic application for
crowd-correcting any mapping file. I've written up a
requirements/design doc here :

Shri Gadkari Launches Integrated Data Collection System
“Information technology should be used as a decision support system in strengthening, maintaining and upgrading National Highways”, said Minster of Road Transport, Highways and Shipping, Shri Nitin Gadkari while launching the state of the art integrated data collection system here today. The system would compile information on road assets, condition of the pavements and traffic through use of laser technology. The Minister also said that Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has been working on developing Highway Radio and Highway Village along with engaging contractors from local areas for plantation, transplantation and maintenance of greenery along National Highways.
The outcome of integrated data collection system will assist in developing an accurate and scientific maintenance planning mechanism, finalizing road safety measures and development of the National Highways network in India. The data collected will be stored and managed through a web based application, which will be hosted in the public domain. The application, when fully developed, can also be accessed by smart phones. Information collected from this project will be useful for Transport Ministry, Finance Ministry, NHAI, State PWDs, Police departments, funding agencies, developers and citizens. The software will be equipped to interface with the indigenous Bhuvan satellite images. The survey vehicle is equipped with three cameras including pavement view, 15 advanced Lasers and GPS connected to Gagan satellite.
The development of Road Asset Management System (RAMS) for the entire National Highways along with collection of requisite data over 3,000 km of the pilot road network is underway as part of the Prime Minister’s Digital India initiative. The data collection over the pilot network of 3,000 km has commenced from Nagpur on 5 May 2015 on trial basis. It is expected that 150 km will be covered in one direction per day. Complete baseline data for 3,000 km will be available by September 2015. Two years’ time series data will be collected over 3,000 km in 2016 and 2017 as part of this project. Ministry of Road Transport & Highways is working on a strategy to collect data for remaining 93,000 km of National Highways. The data collected will be useful for monitoring and auditing maintenance and development work, particularly in inaccessible areas.
A workshop on ‘Road Asset Management System for National Highways’ was also organized to mark the launch of the system.

The full Pune budget book has been converted to excel format that should make it
very easy to search, filter etc. The titles are in Marathi, but it's
Unicode script, meaning you can search through it, copy-paste it
anywhere.

Please see : http://tiny.cc/punebudget2015 (short link to a google doc)

We hope Budget Analysts, Policy Advocates, Activists, Citizens groups
in Pune can use this as a tool in their work. Please share with them.

Click File > Download As in the menu just below the title to download
your own copy for offline use.

We also invite you to join us in collaboratively commenting in this
document. If you're interested, please contact me on nikhil.js [at]
gmail.com

In case you are unable to see the google doc, I've attached an offline copy
of the same with this email. (but note: if any corrections or changes then
they will happen on the google doc and you'll have to get a fresh copy from
there)

I've also attached a PPT I'd previously made as a guide for citizens
to understand Pune's budget book... that should help you if you're
feeling lost in the excel.

Regarding analysis, here's a great one shared by Janwani 2 days back:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8sY5vZfk1W5bWJvVTgtOElnQTA&authuser=0

This (making a usable excel version) is possible to do for other
cities' budget books also if you have only the PDF, won't cost any
money but you'll have to put in quite some time. Get in touch.

We're looking for IT students / professionals to put this data in a
database. Get in touch if you're interested.. can do it as an
internship with our org. (Companies : You can help, but absolutely no
IPR. This is public data; it'll all be open source. You can of course
do it yourself.. data is shared under creative commons)

Sharing some more things coming off it on my end.One good spin-off from this project was that I could get the developers of Tabula to improve the software and make it better at reading Devnagri fonts (all the pdf-to-table converters so far were jumbling things up). https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula/issues/303Sharing my ponderings on how to take this budget opening-up further, and inviting your inputs. One thing I've understood is that what I've made is not truly open in current form, which is basically just a digital replica of the print version. For starters, the data needs to be brought to CSV, which means I have to separate out all the merged headers (yikes!). Any standard naming conventions that I can follow?Next, we need to DATABASE this data. There's different ways of going about that. There's 40+ different tables here, with some having hierarchical relationship. (ie, an entry here is expanded into a list there)Finally, this isn't worth it as a one-off thing, which is why I haven't started off yet. If a database etc is built then it's important to build in structure that will take in future and past data also, amd have not-so-manual ways of importing or checking data.-------------------Sharing an email to a budget analyst friend which lists out some things that might be useful for people dealing with data locked up in PDFs:2 open source tools that were used:PDFtk4all : for splitting heterogenous pdf's into homogenous sections, so that each file only has one kind of table. http://pdftk4all.sourceforge.net/Tabula : for refined conversion from PDF to excel. http://tabula.technologyGo down this thread : https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula/issues/303
 to get a dropbox link to a version that handles Indian scripts and does
 the conversion perfectly without distorting. (they still have to push 
the update to the main version.) (The conversion happens nicely if the 
PDF uses legacy fonts, that is. If the data is in unicode, then God help
 us. Whatever you do, please don't persuade governments to publish large
 tables in pdf in unicode! If they are switching to unicode, then they 
should stop making PDFs of the docs and just give a link that we can 
compare the file with for authenticity.)Our biggest hurdle is usually the with getting the data in Unicode format.Here is a link to the converter I used: https://gist.github.com/answerquest/74c13f73f1bfb21c3177That one was for a particular font that the PMC uses.For Shree-Dev, which is a more popular font and which the bus authority here uses, here's the converter:https://gist.github.com/answerquest/6eabdd3da17a62b18430Detail:
 There's a substitution array of about 200 characters that we usually 
have to map to their unicode equivalents. The converter scripts 
basically does a quick find+replace on all the substitution pairs. But 
in Hindi/Marathi we also have vowel ""maatras"" and a variety of combos, 
and that can get a little tricky, hence some scripting is needed. I 
didn't make the script.. I got it from an online group and adapted it to
 work with what I had.An example of letter-substitutions seen across some popular legacy fonts:http://nikhilsheth.techydudes.net/files/legacyfonts.pngAlso,
 I've recently been working on using mapping to facilitate budget 
analysis. Here's one outcome, for browsing through this year's Pune's 
Participatory Budget:http://nikhilsheth.techydudes.net/files/pune-pb.htmlAnd..
 did you know google spreadsheets turns our regular graphs into 
interactive HTML5 ones? We can embed them on website, like so:http://pugpune.weebly.com/punes-annual-budget.html (note: website is work in progress and this is a temporary address.)All
 the visualizations you'll see in the pages here are coming from google 
spreadsheets, just like excel, making graphs out of table data. No 
coding needed; I just had to copy-paste the html code.Then,There's some quite nice open data sharing platforms out there, example: http://datahub.io/, http://data.okfn.org/ etc. I'm going to explore how to plug into them.--

Are you tied to a specific platform? Also, are these meant to be interactive or static? If you're doing static, then R/ggplot2 is a good choice. Once you set up your plot, you can use coord_flip() to make them horizontal.

There's probably some flavour of ggplot2 that allows you to make interactive visualisations as well.

What technology does the website use?

The easiest way is probably a Javascript graphing library. Almost any
library should handle simple bar graphs, so you might want to go with
the simplest one. If you think that you might work with more complex
graphs later, I would suggest using d3, along with a library like
rickshaw that rides on top of d3.

Gora

The community mapping is one of the ways in social construction of knowledge ( ref 1> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism Â 2>http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/warmotha/epistemology.html )

Part of what we discuss at Datameet is the infrastructure and also access to infrastructure data.But it's important to keep these resources together and make it available through existing established platforms like OpenStreetMap - http://openstreetmap.com. This is heavily dependent on the license the dataset is attached to but it doesn't hurt to talk.If communitygis.in is only a place to store these datasets, I recommend we use Datameet's github repository for this. We have been also storing data on archive.org. This ensures easy access and leverages existing infrastructure, reducing the dependency on a small group of individuals.Happy to talk more about this.Cheers,Sajjad.

So clearly these taluk features do not correspond to the 2001 Census. I cross checked for some areas I have ground knowledge of, and I can say that this dataset is not from any specific era. Some tehsils in the file were created post 2001, while others created in the 90's were not present.

    I think I have the explanation for why I am seeing a good match and
    you are not:

    The problem lies in defining what is the 'sub-district' unit (in
    IND_adm3). Administratively speaking, it is tehsil, below which lies
    CD block. Unfortunately, census gives information by CD block. So
    there are more 'sub-district' units in Census than tehsils in the
    country. GDAM seems to have followed the tehsil concept.

    To check: Karnataka is one state in which tehsil and CD block are
    one and the same. That is why the sub-district layer IND_adm3
    matches perfectly for Karnataka, but not for other states. There
    might be some other states where this holds good, I don't know.

    Anyway, so if one really wants CD block level boundaries, we have to
    look at Justin, I guess.

    But the GDAM boundaries are not 'wrong'.

MGNREGA data is aggregated at this level and I've been hoping to use the data to do some mapping exercises.
The census sub-districts are called differently across states (tahsil, taluk, mandal, etc). You can see the list here:http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/Admin_Units/Admin_links/subdistrict_nomeclature.html
I know that in all the states where census sub-districts are called taluk, mandal, or CD block (with the exception of TN), the census sub-district is identical to the administrative block. 
I've already completed a mapping exercise for Bihar using the census sub-district map and the data matched up pretty well. If the IND_adm3 data is indeed the administrative blocks then I could do a similar exercise with Madhya Pradesh. I'll take a look to see if the data lines up correctly.
Has anybody dug into this issue any deeper? I've heard that tehsil comes from the revenue side whereas taluk, mandal, etc comes from the administrative side but that doesn't explain why the census uses different sub-district units across states.

Hi Sharad,

              I just download the GDAM data again, to confirm what you
              have said.

              I'm going to have to disagree with you about the quality
              of the IND_adm3 data.


              Acoording to the 2001 Census, there are 5454 Sub
                Districts in India. The GDAM dataset has just 2299
              features.

              So clearly these taluk features do not correspond to the
              2001 Census. I cross checked for some areas I have ground
              knowledge of, and I can say that this dataset is not from
              any specific era. Some tehsils in the file were created
              post 2001, while others created in the 90's were not
              present.

              In my opinion the GDAM data is pretty much unusable.

    Dear Eric:

    Here is my understanding:

    1. The census does not create any category, be it tehsil, block or
    mandal. These are statutory or administrative categories created
    under various state laws and programmes at various points in time.
    Note that ""Block"" is same as ""Community Development Block or CD
    Block"". Taluk and tehsil are synymous, and come from the revenue
    side. Block comes from the rural development department. Mandal
    comes from panchayati raj (decentralised governance).

    2. Note also that different states have different decisions about
    how blocks are demarcated. At one end, Karnataka says CD blocks are
    same as tehsils/taluks. Some states have 1-2 blocks per tehsil. Some
    states found tehsils too big and have lots of blocks per tehsil. But
    as far as I know, blocks are strict subsets, and don't straddle
    tehsil boundaries.

    3. Census only has to decide at what level to provide data to the
    user for a given state. E.g. ,in a district census handbook, whether
    to have chapters organized by tehsil or by block. So the table you
    refer to only tells us what choices they made in different states.
    It does not mean (e.g.,) that there are no tehsils in Jharkhand.
    Just that Census did not use that level. But yes, since Census says
    that MP data are reported at Tahsil level, I would think that the
    GADM boundaries for MP will match the tehsil boundaries and hence
    the census data. But the GADAM data may be outdated: tehsils have
    also sometimes been added (districts being split is more common).

    Hope this helps.
    Sharad"

Dear Justin:

I think you are going too far and too fast. A more moderate tone would 
be appreciated.

1. I never criticized anyone: in fact, i said GDAM was ok, and you were 
the one who used fairly strong words against it.
2. I have only clarified out that your layer reflects CD block 
boundaries while GDAM reflects tehsil boundaries. Both may be 'ok' in 
what they represent.
3. The only reason I have not shared any data of mine is simply because 
I have only two datasets: the GDAM one (which is both already available 
and being criticised by some ;-)) and a dataset of admin boundaries 
(district and tehsil) for Karnataka state alone which we paid for and 
got digitized from District Census Handbooks of 1991. When I check GDAM 
or your layer versus this layer, I see no major differences. So then 
what is the point in uploading that data?

For instance, in Karnataka, 10-20 villages are grouped into a 'hobli' by the revenue department. (below taluka level). Similarly, several villages (usually less than those in a hobli) are grouped together into a Gram Panchayat. In Maharashtra, gram panchayat and revenue village are I think identical. (Just to remind ourselves: when we say 'village', we mean revenue village--which is what census uses. Not gram panchayat, nor hamlet of any kind).SharadOn Thursday, August 7, 2014 11:58:14 PM UTC+5:30, Dilip Damle wrote:So it seems to be Country > State > Division > District > Tehsil / Taluk > Some Kind of  Block > Village Let us first get this ans confirm  if each is subset of the other or there are overlaps and if there is any other item missing in between then let us proceed      "

Surat has some discrepancy when it comes to Revenue and Census boundaries. This was something I came across and even local admin bodies in Surat were not aware "

    Dear Shashank:

    I think the bottom line of the thread below was the the IND_adm3
    layer is a reasonably good layer for tehsil boundaries.

    Regarding digitizing village boundaries: seems like we are all
    condemned to reinvent the wheel because GoI/Planning Commission/ISRO
    are not willing to share what they have already done (and in many
    cases 10 times over). 

    For which state are you trying to create a village boundary layer?

    Dear Nagarajan:

    Since you are part of the Gujarat Government, surely you have access

What is the level of granuality that you need to get working?

This data is partly available to the general public in distribution formats like PDF and Images. (see the attached Image)This data could be extracted from these PDF etc, but that would require quite some effort, and if someone is really interested, and is willing to spend time or money, it is doable.Maybe we could have a discussion off the discussion list, and try to get at exactly what you need.Regards,Devdatta Tengshe"

Bumping this up. We have activated few more tasks based on the
priority from the ground support staff. American Red Cross and local
aid groups are downloading OpenStreetMap data and using it to plan
rescue missions - this is huge and important.

Few Red Cross staff is taking some of the maps with them to Kathmandu
right now. https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/hot/2015-April/008102.html
The Kathmandu Living Labs is mobilising as well.

There aren't any other datasets that we can rely on at this point. See
what the status of Google Maps
http://lxbarth.com/compare/#16/27.6892/85.3237

We need more hands to knock off these tasks - http://tasks.hotosm.org/
Arun and I have put together a good starting documentation here -

All map data is updated and packaged for download every 30 minutes -

I am looking for pincode to geo-cordinates mapping for india. I am
aware that the pincode.datameet data is lacking many pincodes and also
seems to have errors (for example, the latitudes for some specific
first-three digits of pincodes is spreading up to 8 degrees).

Some of my questions...

-as the main basis of data is geonames, and that itself has many
errors for india, was there some algorithm which you applied to
identify and/or correct those errors. If there is an algorithm for
that, are you planning to open source that?

-did you also make use of osm data. i was curious if the CC license
under which pincode.datameet provides its data is compliant with osm
terms.

-if not osm, did you use any other source apart from geonames. i could
see some entries made by community over web.

-are you people still actively looking for some alternative resources
or algorithms? do you have any suggestions on the current state of
india pincode-geo mapping?

thanks for your answers...

The source code for pincode.datameet.org is here -

Do feel free to poke around.

This is a crowdsourced effort - there are people making changes all
the time. You can see this in the feed -

I don't think we are using OSM yet. But yes, definitely possible. This
is the coverage of PIN codes on OSM -

Absolutely - we are open on all fronts to improve the data we have. Do

Dear Asif and Harish,

Noticed the email below on the Access India group just
now. 

Could you please share the original document received
from NIC on revising the GIGW
(Guidelines for Indian Government Websites).
Is just the accessibility
part being revised or the whole
document?

Who is collating inputs on behalf of civil society - could
we all send emails, if so to which email id and by when?

Apologies for bothering you but news of the revision doesn't
seem to be available in the public domain. And there is so much to input.

Thanks,

Vaishnavi

Apart from social media mobilisation, activities include meeting government officials, campaign activities in buses and poor neighborhoods, and posters and parchas on the BRT stretch. We are still not clear on what will happen, but you are invited to the campaign. As you know, Delhi is the most polluted city that humanity has ever lived in, which has pernicious effects on the health and well-being of delhi's residents, particularly infants and young children. We hope to start a public campaign around issues of pollution and public transport using this lever of the BRT. Please feel free to call me at 9871116763 if you have more questions, or ask here.  WarmlyAashish

The focus is for now on public transport and to improve efficiency and ridership with open data. Private transport are mostly efficient and free market takes care of innovation, which is not the case in state owned transport agencies.
Regarding realtime data, we are not pushing to implement them yet. We are rather focusing on getting what is available, static data and any GPS data of units which are already in place.
And yes, the agencies will be involved for the dialogue around all of the work.

The value of the names (for profiling population clusters) increase with granularity. Would recommend sharing at state level. You could potentially annotate with variables (e.g., abstract region - north/south) to make it little more interesting. 2. There are cases involving people getting married, and namesnot being entered properly. You can use the relationship informationto clean the data a bit before you generate the summaries to increaseaccuracy. -Venkata

as someone who worked with the voter lists, including an analysis of
trends (http://www.raphael-susewind.de/blog/2012/noor-mohd-ali), I would
personally NOT put them online in disaggregate form. I would only share
aggregate data (i.e. the 50 most frequent names in state X and their
prominence over time, or some such). If you do put them online, I would
do so at state level only, not further disaggregated. But I DO think
there are big privacy issues here. There was a discussion on this on the
list a few months back as well - spurred by this post by Snehashish
Ghosh:
http://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/electoral-databases-2013-privacy-and-security-concerns

My 5 cents,
Raphael

It does not convey anything of demographic importance particularly apart from name analysis.And you did not mention if you would be adding only first names or full names. Adding full names means all the women will have their age mentioned! And for those with uncommon names it would definitely be an issue.You can eithera) Remove name and keep only gender and age, randomize the names.  If you want to convey gender and age distribution among the population.  b) If you are doing name analysis.      Some options:    - If you want to convey information like the age-wise distribution 
of a name (a little esoteric and still not as demographically relevant 
but this dataset allows for it), then aggregation would work.    - Use first names only    - Adding only the surname initials,     - Generate unique hashes for surname so that name analysis will still be possible according to surnames but identities will not be revealed. Alternatively you can have two datasets, one with unique hashes for name and the other with surname. This way, community name based analysis is also feasible.  -- Regards,Johnson Chetty

work with the Internews Earth Journalism Network-
a global community of environmental journalists working to cover topics of
global importance. We have been pioneering the concept of GeoJournalism by combining
increasingly available environmental data with the use of new mapping and data
visualization tools to launch regionally based platforms that add all kinds of
context to journalists’ stories. Previously, we have created GeoJournalism
sites focused on the state of the Amazon (InfoAmazonia.org),
forest/marine/natural disaster in Indonesia (Ekuatorial.com),
and poaching in South Africa (oxpeckers.org)Most recently, we have been
working with a team of South Asian journalists at The Third Pole, to launch an open geospatial database focused on
Asia's water tower. Located at data.thethirdpole.net, this
compendium of scientific data on water issues is sourced from leading organizations monitoring water
in Asia including ICIMOD, IWMI, and SaciWATERS. 
 We have two articles outline the role and goal of the site here:
http://earthjournalism.net/stories/open-data-in-asia2019s-water-tower-data-thethirdpole.net
http://www.thethirdpole.net/opening-up-data-sharing-in-asias-water-tower/In 2015 we are planning on using the data we have collected in combination with new data to create visualization of water issues throughout the region. We certainly hope this presents this community with an opportunity for collaboration. If you have ideas or know where to source open data about water please feel free to contact me Many thanks and best wishes.  "

This is a great opportunity to tell us what open data project you`re working on and how you think your initiative is making a change to our societies, beyond economic impact. Our new repository is part of a research project to explore and analyze the social impact of open data outside the U.S. (More info in the blog post below.)Please submit your case story through this link, or send it to intern...@sunlightfoundation.com before the end of Feb. 4! All you need to do is give a very short description of your project and how you think it's driving change.Best and thanks,Juliahttp://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2015/01/23/help-us-build-an-evidence-base-on-the-social-impact-of-open-data/ Help us build an evidence base on the social impact of open data!by Júlia Keserű·         policyJAN. 23, 2015, 8 A.M.Photo by Flickr user Justin GrimesTalking about the economic benefit of open data is one good way to describe open data’s impact, and provides a ""great rationale"" for the release of relevant data sets. However, open data’s impact does not lie solely in the economic sphere. Government openness may produce tremendous other benefits for our societies: increasing state or institutional responsiveness, reducing levels of corruption and clientelism, building new democratic spaces for citizens, empowering local and disadvantaged voices, or enhancing service delivery and effective service utilization.But how effective open data and government transparency actually are at producing these social benefits is not yet at all evident. At a time when ""fake government openness"" and ""open-washing"" are increasingly seen as a risk to the transparency movement’s credibility, there is burning need for more evidence on how opening up government information helps us all use resources more “effectively, equitably and sustainably to meet people’s needs.” Developing indexes and comparative studies on a wide range of topics (e.g. budgets, thefreedom of the web, aid, perceived corruption, etc.) is a crucial first step, but in order to get more buy-in from our policy-makers and a critical mass of citizens, we need to look beyond those indexes and find other ways to analyze the effect of open data on societies.Much of the existing literature seeking to measure the impact and effectiveness of transparency and open data accountability initiatives seem to face a common challenge: It is incredibly difficult to come up with definitive, evidence-based generalizations about how ""x"" type of initiatives produce ""y"" kinds of effects. The field has yet to coalesce around a theory of change, for one, and there are significant methodological challenges around comparability and unevenness of evidence.At Sunlight, we would like to help change that. As a continuation of our work to provide examples of how opening up information makes a difference in communities across the U.S., we want to tackle some of these challenges through a new research project to explore and analyze the social impact of open data outside the U.S. Our goal is to build a strong evidence base that might empower further generalizations and to develop a few potential theories of change that capture the nuances, complexity and messiness of this broad agenda. With generous support from the Open Data for DevelopmentResearch Fund of the OGP Open Data Working Group, our research aims to identify the factors that increase the likelihood that open data initiatives will achieve their stated goals in a particular context. We also seek to understand why and how these factors lead to success or failure.As a first step, we are asking you — the community of transparency and open government advocates, civic hackers, investigative journalists and policy makers — to provide us with illustrative examples of how open data and transparency projects are having impact on our societies.Are you working on an open data project that improves the level of political participation and citizen engagement? Do you know any tech-based transparency project that you think might lead to change in social behavior? Is your transparency initiative aimed at decreasing the perception of corruption, fraud or waste. Has it led to more investigations or better investigative journalism? Are you aware of an open data initiative that improves public service delivery or social policies? From environmental through educational and public safety to health outcomes, we're looking for examples — both on the local and national level — that look beyond the direct economic benefits of open data and illustrate how government openness produces social benefits.We realize that the definitions we use here are a bit broad, but our goal is to encourage everyone working in this field to help us build a strong evidence base that we can further filter and analyze. So please help us and submit your case story through this link, or send it to international@sunlightfoundation.com before the end of Feb. 4! All you need to do is give a very short description of your project and how you think it's making a change in our societies. Any supporting documents (theories of change, articles, impact stories) in both your local language or in English are welcome too.Access to government information and decision-making processes is a fundamental democratic principle. Open data and digital transparency are one important way of achieving that access.

Geography
Workshops At Jayanagar, Bengaluru


The Indian Institute of Geographical
Studies (TIIGS), in partnership with AarogyaSeva, will conduct
geography workshops for children above the age of 8, and adults who
are interested in looking at geography in new ways. Parents are
encouraged to join with their children to start interesting and
enriching conversations and co-learning.
Since 2000, TIIGS has been working
towards bringing new, relevant, exciting, and fun ways for children
and adults to learn geography and its applications. TIIGS’s mission
is to deliver “critical knowledge, critical understanding, and
critical skills” in geography. The workshops organized by them take
the discipline of geography far beyond the textbooks and gets
participants excited about geography and its fascinating questions.
As part of this mission, TIIGS will
offer four workshops on 13 and 14 December. Venue:  Seva House in
2nd Block, Jayanagar, Bengaluru.
One on “latitudes and longitudes”
will help participants understand how these lines help us in so many
aspects of our lives. 

The “Mapping the neighbourhood”
workshop will have participants out in the neighbourhood, applying
geography principles to mapping the area and learning to look at a
neighbourhood anew. (Come with comfortable shoes, a cap, and bottle
of drinking water.)
Two other workshops will focus on
current and recent events. 

One on Ebola will look at the origins
and spread of the deadly disease, responses to it, and the
geographies associated with it. 

Another workshop will examine the
fascinating geographical concepts that can be learned by studying the
story of Edward Snowden, an intelligence contractor the USA who
leaked highly secret files of the USA and is now in exile in Russia.
Participants are asked to bring pens,
pencils, notebook, and atlas (if they have one).
Prior
registration is required. Seats are limited and available only on a
first-come, first-serve basis. Fees: Rs 500 per workshop

But when I surimpose satellite images on this population map, the ward n°177, supposedly crawded, contains mostly vegetated area. I double checked everything and the only explanation I could find is that the census wards and the wards extracted from the previous website have different bounderies.Would someone has an idea or a ""census 2011"" ward wise shp that I could use to get the right population in the matching ward ?Thanks a lot !"

1032,Thejesh GN,#topic/datameet/DjXAynXIepA,1,2014-11-26 23:40:00,opendata.json – Format for making Open Data Discoverable,"Initially I wrote this as an email to the group. Then I thought it could also be a blog post. So i blogged it on my website. This was driven by my own itch to find the data and as well as the number of data queries we get on the list.This is targeted at Data Publishers and Developers, though the end beneficiary is data analyst or a researcher who wants to find data.If you are a publisher or developer. Please do get in touch with me. I would like to talk to you. Now go ahead and read the rest, don't forget your ☕.  ----It’s a pain to search for Open Data on the web. 
I publish quite a bit of data. As you could see on the OpenBangalore.
 The data is in different formats and is at different urls. There is no 
easy way to find it other than going through the list. You can’t find it
 by source, copyright information, contact information etc. 
It’s difficult for me to find my own data. Google search helps only 
to certain extent. But ultimately it depends on human search capability 
or going through the catalog or listings. It shouldnt be that difficult.
 Also keeping the centralized catalog up to date is hard and doesn’t 
scale. 
There are ways this has been handled on the web. XML sitemaps
 is one example. Where in the site map gives a list of page (with other 
data) to a search engine to crawl and build an index. Another example is
 API JSON, where in 
API creator will publish the information about his APIs in the form of 
api.json and aggregators can use it aggregate. Both are similar and 
proven models. Why not use the same model for open data?
So please welcome
opendata.json – Format for making your open data discoverable.
What I am working on?

Format specification: The above one is an example for opendata.json.
 I am yet to write a detailed specification. I have started it. I will 
keep you updated on it. Writing example opendata.jsons allows me to face
 all the challenges that end-user (publisher) will face. That helps me 
in writing specification. 
Aggregator/Search engine: A FOSS based Aggregator/Search engine. I will implement ping and search functionality as part of v0.1,

Why not RDF?
– I wanted it to be extremely simple and developer friendly. JSON i thought was the best format.
How about metadata of actual data?
– Its much more complicated. Probably we can have a metadata in a 
separate json file to simplify and decouple them. I am not working on it
 now. Let me know if you are interested in it.
I am not a developer or publisher of data, how does it help me?
– You can find open data much more easily. You are an indirect user of this protocol, but end goal is to make your search easy.
What about time?
– Time is represented as  ISO 8601 format in our case. The full format 
is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+ZZ:ZZ. But you can always specify only the period
 which makes sense. For example only YYYY-MM  for a month. or YYYY for 
an year. That said you can have just MM, it has to be YYYY-MM. You get 
the idea?
What about location?
– I know its important, Just like time, location is an important 
dimension for the data on which user would want to search. But I have 
not thought through it. I will keep you updated on it. If you have 
ideas, please share. 
Can a shape file be discoverable through it?
– Yes, though I would like to see more open formats in the “format” tag. We can’t avoid shape files as yet.
We don’t publish static data but we have an API, so what do we do?
– I am not sure yet. But how about, format=”api” and url is a pointer to
 api.json format. That way we wont be inventing anything new but also 
will be supporting open data apis. But for sure we need to think about 
this.
Is the specification commercial friendly?
– Yes. The license for the opendata.json 
 is distributed with the same license as sitemaps.org, which is Creative
 Commons ShareAlike. I know all most all commercial and non commercial 
sites use sitemaps.
What’s the timeline?
– Planning to complete the v0.1 speficiation document before 15 
december. Then will talk to some of the data publishers to see if they 
can adopt. By the end of january/2015 I will have alpha version of the 
search engine out. If you are a data publisher, let me know, I would 
love to discuss.
Will it be your individual effort?
– As of now yes, but I would like to have collaborators. Email me. I 
will also publish it on Data{Meet}. As I sense people on Data{Meet} will
 be indirectly using this protocol.
How does it look?
– opendata.json is a valid json. Here is an example for weather data on openbangalore. 
How can I help?
– Help me in writing specification. Help me by implementing it if you 
are a publisher. Help me in writing the intial search engine. Everything
 we write will be community/commercial friendly. Thej--Thejesh GN ⏚ ತೇಜೇಶ್ ಜಿ.ಎನ್http://thejeshgn.comGPG ID :  0xBFFC8DD3C06DD6B0

We had a great meetup yesterday talking about interesting use cases around OpenStreetMap, it was packed and wonderful.
Today, we are going to get together and map! 5pm onwards at the Center for Internet and Society. No. 194, 2nd ‘C’ Cross, Domlur, 2nd Stage, Bengaluru – 560 071. It's near the Domlur Club. Here's a map - http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/166560383
Please update your RSVP http://www.meetup.com/GeoBLR/events/218658917/
We will do a brief introduction on how to get started with OSM editing. There are couple of other ideas - make a two minute video on using iD for the Datameet video channel, get people out on the street to do some surveying etc. It's going to be fun! 
Please bring your computer and it will be great if you can create an account on OpenStreetMap.org. Let me know if you have any questions. 
Directions - 
If you are taking the Metro, it's a short walk or a rickshaw ride from the Indiranagar station. If you are taking a bus, it's a short walk from the Domlur Flyover or the Domlur Bus Stand.
There's plenty of parking spaces around the venue. In case you need directions call CIS office (080 409 262 283) or me (9742979601).
See you later today!
Cheers, 
Sajjad.

I am happy to inform you that today's EPW carries a piece on ""Spatial
variation in the 'Muslim vote' in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, 2014"",
which I have co-authored with Raheel Dhattiwala:

http://www.epw.in/ejournal/show/1/_/3024

We demonstrate that Muslims' electoral choices vary a lot from
constituency to constituency, implying that ""vote banks"" operate on a
much more local level than hitherto assumed. We also explore a few
factors that might shape this variation: minority concentration, riot
history, and ethnic coordination.

More relevant to this list: we also published interactive maps and a
replication dataset under an open license, which contains booth-wise
estimates of the Muslim electorate. Those of you working on religion and
politics might be interested to play with it:

http://www.raphael-susewind.de/blog/2014/

Let me know if you find that data useful,
and/or if you have any questions about it,

Best,
Raphael

        Hello all!!
 
We are doing a project as part of our class on Digital Networks and we
decided to analyze the impact of social media on recent Kashmir Floods.
Since we are novices to this field but nevertheless very enthusiastic to do
something exciting in a short period of time, we would be so grateful if
you could suggest us some tools to analyze Facebook/Twitter data and also
any useful references to similar studies.
 
Thanks and Regards

International Workshop on Semantics for DataVenue: JNU Convention Centre, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.Date: 2nd November 2014Time: 13 - 16 hrs Research data is crucial for scientific investigations. The nature of data transactions and collaborations observed in international scientific communities clearly indicates that Big Data is a topic that is interdisciplinary and has cross-discipline applications. Metadata is usually associated with its role in retrieval of resources from large collections. Semantics enriched metadata facilitates context driven services that relate to the changing and evolving user communities that are often cross disciplinary. There are many metadata standards advocated for different domains, services and even entities such as organizations, persons, geoentities and services among several others. However, with increasing interest in research and practice of Big Data and availability of data, it is necessary to focus on Metadata for data which is a research area deemed to be nascent as of now. It is necessary to develop a community and an international think tank around the idea of 'metadata for data' and also focus on 'semantics' along with metadata at its inception itself. Data by itself does not directly convey anything but when enriched with semantics and metadata several useful services can be designed. SeMDAT is a workshop with a scope intended to explore the role of semantics and metadata for data.Objectives: The workshop aims to bring together international experts and practitioners in Big Data. SeMDAT will provide a platform for discussions highlighting opportunities, issues and challenges in Big data sourcing, storage, processing and applications. The workshop will emphasize on pragmatic approaches required to progress towards semantic solutions for data.Format: Workshop will consist of keynote speakers, and invited lectures demonstrations from world experts in Big Data. The content and proceedings will be comprehensive of the sub-topics and issues with emphasis on important aspects such as policy, access and availability, standards, tools and technology and processes among othersParticipation: (not limited to... ): Data managers, data science faculty, library and information professionals, research data managers, researchers, faculty students in related area across domains and services.Registration is free for this workshopFurther Details: http://drtc1.isibang.ac.in/semdat/

I am thinking of doing this, but I don't mind someone else doing it. The way I was thinking of doing it, given my non-technical but social sciencey background was to randomly select about 100 trains and see delay differences between different types of trains.

Interestingly, the Railway Board didn't seem to have this data in one place. They wrote to all the 17 zones, who wrote to all the divisions(I was copied in all this communication!). Some divisions gave me hand-complied information. One zone asked for Rs 16000 for the photocopying charges. One proactive station manager called me to get clarity on the information being sought! A few divisions out-rightly refused citing a previous CIC ruling. What I asked for is perhaps a little different from your query(which is even more interesting). But my guess is - there doesn't seem to be such centralised information with the railway board. The zones seem to have their own independent systems with varying level of automation. Regards,Rajesh

Srinivas and Rahul, since you offered to help with this, what do you think of a small site which displays this information, say, for the next few months, on a daily basis? Would that be too cumbersome to do? It might get the issue attention, and perhaps some rectification before the budget too (I might be too hopeful here). Nikhil and I are working on other aspects of the railways as well (such as the fact that elite trains come on nice platforms - last platforms of new delhi railway station) while non-elite trains don't, general class travel for the poor has become much worse over the years, especially in holidays (so we are trying to find out occupancy rates in different classes), the differences in facilities in different classes. We are also thinking of doing some fieldwork. By way of disclosure, this is just a personal project and we have no funding, though we are employed by a research organisation that pays us salaries to do other work. We would be very happy to work on any collaborative venture. We would also be happy if you go ahead and do this, the issue needs to get out. We are not bothered with getting our names on a publication :)So perhaps at this time I should say that others who can contribute and want to contribute should join in, and then we can have a small meeting over skype/phone. Do let us know what do you think, and thanks again! WarmlyAashish

Women Scientists in India also tend to be less visible than their male counterparts, and public awareness of Indian Women Scientists is low. IndiaBioScience will be organising a series of public events to raise the profile of women scientists on one of the most-popular online encyclopaedias - Wikipedia. At these events, participants will be encouraged to create and complete profiles of Indian Women in Science. We will conduct the first three edit-a-thons on 11th, 13th and 14th October.  The last of these events, on 14th October, will coincide with Ada Lovelace Day, an international day to celebrate the achievements of women in Science, Technology and Math. For more details and to participate click here (http://www.indiabioscience.org/content/women-science-wiki-edit-thon).Contact the IndiaBioScience Team for more details: www.indiabioscience.org  & te...@indiabioscience.orgNandini Rajamani Robin, PhDCo-Director, IndiaBioScienceNational Centre for Biological Sciences CampusGKVK, Bellary RoadBangalore 560065, Indiaemail: nand...@instem.res.inwebsite: www.indiabioscience.orgtelephone: +91 80 23666223, +91 9449002296personal: www.glidingsquirrel.in

    Sumit:

    You are right. 2001 data were only available on a 'paid' basis, and
    were not in public domain. I know this because a colleague had to
    purchase the 2001 dataset for her city of study at the cost of more
    than 1 lakh (back in 2005).

    I guess we could write a joint letter to Census of India asking them
    to release the 2001 data since they have already released 2011
    dataset for free!

But don't lose hope, there are ways to approximate it.1)Firstly you can get names of wards. They tend to be the names that people often use for the area, but not always. You can get the list of wards from the open Bangalore Data that has been collected by Thej (http://openbangalore.org/available-data/)2) Another good source is the OpenStreetMap database. I am attaching two exports from the Bangalore area, which will be useful. The first file consists of all features that are tagged with place=suburb or place=locality. The other file consists of data, where the relationship of 'is contained in' is set up. Most of the features are set to be in Bangalore, but in some cases, the sub divisions of the localities/suburbs is mentioned.Coming to Meera's question on how websites do it; Basically they have this data from various sources. Given enough time and effort, anyone can come up with this. Maybe it's one of those things that we can pick up in one of the hackathons.Regards,Devdatta"

So here is a handy browser that someone built on top of Geoplanet that may give you a sense of the sort of place relationships and data they have. http://isithackday.com/geoplanet-explorerThe Small World database itself has been augmented with data from multiple other sources, and depending on the use case you have in mind, it may be worth asking them if they can just give you a dump in a more compact form.

    I have not quite figured out what Mahalwari means, but wikipedia
    says Mahalwari was in Uttar Pradesh, and it sounds more like
    zamindari.

    I am very sure that the system in Madhya Pradesh was Malguzari, see

Data portals for cities through data.gov.in? [4 Updates]


 Data portals for cities through data.gov.in?

srinivas kodali <iota....@gmail.com> Jun 06 06:22PM +0530
        
      Hi,
 
Our Open data policy makes it mandatory for ministries to categorize their
department datasets into open-data or restricted and release them publicly.
But the same is not true with city/municipal agencies. Most important
datasets like public transport, financial spendings, pollution levels,
water  usage fall under state/municipal agencies.
 
These are important datasets which need to be made public. Making local
agencies release datasets through data.gov.in would bring data standards
locally and also improve community participation. Think of it,
bangalore.data.gov.in would be an interesting page to have.
 
Pointing out the equivalent open-access pages across the world.

why not have similar ones for india, there is enough data around. Delhi has
real-time pollution level monitored, real-time locations of buses, water
usage data is available from water boards.
 
What do we need for this to happen?

      Srinivas,
 
I agree we should have one!  Can we get a few other people in teh Bangalore
group together and start lobbying the NIC and bangalore to create one?
 
STarting with meetings and letters with Bangalore stakeholders? THen see
about who is interested in starting the conversation in other cities.
 
Chennai might be movign toward a portal but I'm nto sure, I don't see why
Bangalore can't have one or Delhi or Mumbai or PUne.

Data.gov.in mentioned a meeting with Tamil Nadu a while ago.  I will try to
follow up with them and see if there is a follow meeting, maybe DataMeeters
in Chennai can attend.

That's true but getting the portals and the agreement that working on data standards is the most important step.  
The NIC experience with data.gov.in is a good place to learn from.

1239,Satyarupa Shekhar,#topic/datameet/yZtEvTKzHTU,13,2014-07-01 22:25:00,Re: city portals,"Dear all,

I am jumping into this conversation a little late but very excited to see the excitement around city data portals!

I lead the City Governance and Open Data Initiatives areas of work at Transparent Chennai, Chennai. In February 2014, we signed a two-year MoU with the city government to help develop a data portal and a dashboard to help them use data for planning and monitoring. However, the focus is on comprehensively improving their data management practices - from collection to use, rather than solely on opening up their data. Transparent Chennai also signed a second MoU in June 2014 to work with the city government to create, collect and use data on urban poverty. In both MoUs, portals and apps are planned outputs, but our efforts are directed to embedding the capacity within the government to manage the entire process.

We are looking to take these efforts to other cities in the country. I would love to have more detailed conversations around interoperability, privacy and other related issues with the community. We would also love to get help on these projects on a full-time basis, so if anyone is keen please do write to me.

Best,
Satyarupa

It is no surprise that the public transit here is in a bad state right now. Bringing an aware community in, to enhance the experience, might just give us an upper hand into pressing authorities to improve quality of service.Just to add, citizen initiatives in Nagpur are picking up now, so as to resolve civic issues without involving any of religion, politics and money. Contributions to an openly available GTFS feed seemed like a pilot initiative to get the tech community directly involved.to start with, I have put up an event[1] on our local Meetup group[2]. I am using a reference to Google Maps because it resonates with a majority, at least here in Nagpur. I will try to get the community introduced with GTFS and spread out a plan of action to bring Nagpur's bus transit information to Google Maps. Eventually, I would like to get the community acquainted with Open Data and have some contributions to OSM data for Nagpur.Thoughts?Links[1]: http://www.meetup.com/Nagpur-Techies/events/207542312/[2]: http://www.meetup.com/Nagpur-Techies/P.S.: I would be glad to connect with anybody on or off this mailing list, who is/was involved with Open Data in Nagpur.--Nikhil Lanjewarhttps://github.com/mavenikhttps://twitter.com/rhetonik

All the data found on google within India was collected on filed and not sourced from transport agencies. Most transport agencies don`t have the data at all not even on paper. I am not aware of the scenario in nagpur transport agency. You need at-least a list of route names before you start collecting the data. The best way to collect bus-stops is through OSM or google apart from crowdsourcing & getting onto field. But the challenging part is the schedules, with the traffic conditions the schedules will be often wrong even if the agency has it. Bus schedules are critical part of GTFS. Also the routes up-down directions might have two different set of bus-stops, you can only collect this data from field. The first step for building the data is find what data you already have from the agency, probably through an RTI. Then you can decide how to proceed with creating the GTFS.If you need some help with GTFS or bring up the community in nagpur, please feel to reach out.Regards,Srinivas Kodali"

We have tried this with Datameet and other meetups. Weekends are

prefer to stay back home and do other things.

With GeoBLR, I've tried doing it on Fridays and Saturdays. The
feedback was that people like to keep their weekend open and do it on
a Thursday. This seem to have worked out pretty well for us so far.

I would say we are still very early to start branching out into

heads around what GeoBLR might be able to do and we'd love to take

least right now, is not to split up and expand, but try and get
everyone together as much as possible.

If there are people interested in helping us run GeoBLR, do reach out
to us off list and we can discuss how to go about it. But we can only
consider expanding next year because, like I said, we are still
figuring out what GeoBLR has to become.

That said, the mailing list fairly active in case people want to

Either that ro something got lost in the translation. Such as Bharat Forge. (The stock price is around Rs. 900 now, and even in July was at least 630)2) The concept of ""standalone"" no longer makes much sense financially, as most companies (especially infra and Indian biggies) work through multiple entities in which they hold a large or majority stake3) Some stocks like Asian Paints don't show price data. Btw, are you adjusting EPS for bonus/splits?Deepak Shenoyhttp://www.capitalmind.inTwitter: @deepakshenoy

I have uploaded a village boundary layer for Karnataka (shapefile 
format). Also has a README file explaining its source, strengths and 
limitations. Link is:

https://app.box.com/s/fah79mv5fe951ywmq5d3

Hope this is useful. Would be nice if folks who use it post information 
on how it was used.

I should mention that we paid for the layer but would like to make it 
freely available. Ideally, if it were ported to Google maps, that would 
help a lot of people. But that would also need better geo-rectification.

I have seen SUB-DISTT codes of 0000 before for states, districts, and very large cities (i.e. Hyderabad) - but this is something new!?  I believe the census table is wrong.  But something that is kinda throwing me off as well is your data has two of these, both with identical records, and the same Taluk, but you can see i think it should be split (but not certain)?a last thing to throw in the mix is that in a different census gis dataset, the north part has :2922000302365700 Chikkayarahalli and the south part has 2922000402378200 Hongahalli - these are both in the census table as well...Can anyone make sense of this!??Thanks!  Justin"

Help novices (me included) find their own interests and develop their own skills for use in the area.3. Mobilize those data workers, especially the ones not internet-savvy, who have ground-level expertise and experience in using data in the social sector, and who can provide case studies and some kind of validation for data made available by Government agencies.

    Dear Sudhira:

    Thanks for this. A small query: have you checked how this BMP layer
    sits on Google Earth? Seems to me that it is about 400m shifted to
    the southeast. See screenshot, where I have also overlaid my layer
    for BBMP (not BMP) wards. (And I think the BBMP layer is sitting
    correctly, because it follows prominent roads.

After independence Delhi grew very fast because of influx including displaced people from Pakistan.Then came many developed colonies and institutions like IIT, JNU and many more.These acquired the agriculture land belonging to the Villagers. The residential part of the Villages was kept untouched and these are all the villages that you see today and most of the land is owned by original owners who mainly live off renting houses. The outer Delhi still has many villages with the Agriculture land still intact. That is the story in short.For more specific info you are free to  write to me directly on my email address cadvision@gmail .comI will help to the extent that I know or can find out."
1289,Eric Dodge,#topic/datameet/d4HMfGw8yJ4,3,2014-08-25 13:44:00,Re: [datameet] Re: Delhi Locations and Questions,"Hi Justin,There are many different systems for transliterating Hindi script although the GoI has officially adopted the Hunterian system. I would guess that spellings originating from local offices are more likely to be non-Hunterian, idiosyncratic, phonetic, etc., although not necessarily wrong. However, they are probably more likely to have outright misspellings as well because workers at local offices tend to have less command of English compared to workers at the Centre (and publications from the Centre are probably proofread more closely). 
I would opt to use spellings from the central government publication primarily because they are the official, standardized version. I would only use the local spellings if I was creating some output specifically for use at the local level.

In some cases, these localities got their name from the village that used to exist there. Sometimes it might be a road, or an point of interest like a Temple, or lake. In some cases, they refer to the closest Railways Station; In some cases, the developer of that area named the locality.There just isn't one unique way to refer to localities.Furthermore if you talk to several different people living in one locality, there is a good chance that they will refer to the locality by different names.I hope that this sheds some light on the chaotic addressing in India.Regards,Devdatta Tengshe"

Neighborhoods may have their own internal addressing scheme defined by the local resident welfare association  eg. Ram Colony, Kalu Sarai, B4 Vasant Kunj..Neighbourhoods are very loosely defined and are officially defined only in the electoral rolls, where voter lists are prepared and voting booths have to be allocated.All this is based on personal observations, someone else can probably expose this dark corner better.   I am beyond confused!?!  Does anyone on this forum live in any of these larger cities?  How do you refer to where you live or where you are from?The real fun starts outside the city.

Tisk  meaning a 3 way road junction.When people from bus wanted to get down here they said ""Tiskar Devay"" in konkani meaningLet me get down AT the Tisk So Tisk meant Three way junction  and Tiskar meant At three way junction. As the shops and commerce grew at this place people started staying there then the word Usago Dropped from the Usgao Tisk and AR was a permanent integral now everyone calls the place as Tiskar. And very few non goans know what is a Tisk. "

How has this act been used in the past?Why was there a push to include digital offenders?

I  was suggesting couple of the groups members we plan for the open access week much ahead this time and try to get real attention to open-data in the country across all major cities. Apart from hosting meet-ups and camps, we can try getting publications, really interesting visualizations, applications and data tools, make important datasets public, articles over major newspapers. 

We can solve the pin-codes problem and publish the dataset, we can try to get the open standards in transportation document published during that week. Publish one resource every day of the week.
Let`s try to get in NIC and Department of Science & Technology, Department of Electronics & IT. The government is trying to get closer to the public with http://mygov.nic.in/ and https://egovstandards.gov.in/node/2202 , they should be interested in helping us.

Anybody wants to suggest any RTI`s we can file to get out some important information within next two months. Air pollution data can be sought too. Electricity consumption, affordable housing, water consumption, Emergency calls of crime, fire, accidents (EMRI might have this data for Hyderabad, Chennai), public property data, municipal waste data are few areas we can get something out.

Bangalore has a lot of municipal data, IBM is helping bangalore managing water supply, ESRI is helping Bangalore Municipal Corporation with mapping the city.
This can help us show the importance and use cases of open-data, we can also propose NIC to work on the city portals when they see the importance.

I am working on a Dharavi Redevelopment Planning idea and was wondering if anyone here would have access to any kind of data pertaining to Dharavi. From my research, I have learnt that the Dharavi Redevelopment Committee commissioned by the Mumbai municipality did conduct a household survey there through a data collection intermediary called MASHAL but this data is currently not available in the public domain. There is no information online about the ownership of the data, whether it lies with the city municipality, and if it does, whether it will be accessible through provisions under RTI. Hence shooting in the dark through this email.
Any pointers to any other datasets pertaining to Dharavi will also immensely inform our outcomes. Thank you all very much in advance.
Best,

Justin - apologies if I wasn't clear on my requirements earlier. I am personally interested in looking at socio-economic data: wages, poverty rates, labor markets information, access to credit, education status etc at a household level. I hope to use this data to see if I am able to make a convincing economic argument that the value of people living and working in Dharavi is greater (or can be made greater) than the value of the land value itself. At an aggregate level, reports indicate that the value of economic output from Dharavi is close to $600 million!! If this is true, then I want to test the hypothesis that increasing productivity through efficient design (which put capital in their hands or improves working conditions etc) will help people perceive Dharavi as less of a 'slum' and more of an industrial powerhouse for Mumbai.
The maps that you sent are extremely useful for the planners in my team though. If you come across anything else on similar lines- kindly request you to forward it as well. It will be of immense help.
Thank you so much again.

Some things were clarified in a meeting yesterday morning with others who were interesting in finding partners to crack the pincode area issue. At the meeting was a person with SOI and he stated that there are indeed pincodes with multiple post offices in them, and also post offices that serve multiple pincodes.
We examined issues around why we need to care about pincodes.  Mostly because it is the most known geographic identifier for common people. We also started to brainstorm how to come up with a plan so that a group like ours along with several other partners could work together to attempt to crowdsource the issue.

I wanted to know- whats the best way to make this data available to people online? If I wanted to add the data to OSM can that be done (opendata and all?)?
I have also been working on digitizing some old maps of Hyderabad (from the first comprehensive city survey that was done during 1912-1914).link to some of those maps on top of google maps are here- http://203.124.106.1/~amphi/gunj/
how do I make this data available- as in what would be the best way to do it?I am aware of the grey area on the open data tag being ascribed to this kind of derived work but can the ward(and circle and zone) boundaries be put up on OSM?
These historical maps were obtained from an MIT repository- http://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/45288

But it will be majorly on the following topics1. Standards and Structured data storage of transport data
2. Different practices in transport applications/data analysis3. Copy rights and licenses of data4. Open data and Open Source implementations in transport  
It will be majorly a technical document with minor details on open-data policies and advantages. Individuals who want to contribute need to be fairly aware of the following technologies:
These are just to give you an idea what you will be working on. You don`t need to know everything 1. Database design2. Exposure to OSM, Geojson and Maps/Tranport related specs
3. Exposure to handling Big data (The data can be around 10-40 GB easily)4. Standards in Transport data (GTFS, GTFS Realtime,SIRI)5. Expertise in Socket Programming, Protocol Buffers, real-time data protocols.
We will be evaluating and implementing couple of applications/protocols before we recommend it. It will be fairly a technical document. The document will be shared in the group after completion for two reviews.  Everybody can contribute in terms of suggestions and criticizing the suggestions.

I have been discussing on the same issue at different Transport forums. Here is my article on TheCityFix which highlights the same points who put in : http://thecityfix.com/blog/across-divide-information-communication-technologies-ict-data-connect-users-transport-systems-suvajt-sengupta/  My job, expertise and interest revolves around this subject and I will be quite eager to participate in this exercise.  If we can come up with the open-data standard, we can surely push them into Central Govt & STU technical specifications.  It is the need of the hour. I can clearly say, STUs are losing millions of investment money for ITS implementation due to lack of this data and communication standard.    I propose to have a first level coordination meeting on this subject.     Nisha,   Thanks for creating the datameet wiki on this subject. I want upload some more documents and references on this subject.    Can you let me know how to do that ?Regards,Suvajit Sengupta"

""Global experience has demonstrated convincingly that access to data leads to breakthroughs in scientific understanding as well as to economic and public good, in addition to several benefits to civil society.   Given the deployment of substantial level of investment of public funds in collection of data and the untapped potentials of benefits to social society, it has become important to make available non-sensitive data for legitimate and registered use.""

But the software required to ensure easy PDF/UA creation (PDF accessibility for screen readers) is invariably paid i.e. Adobe Acrobat Pro. Else, training on the following will have to take place http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf.html which will be a mammoth exercise.  The spectrum of PDF types (hybrid, /A, /UA etc) is also prone to lead to confusion. The following article on document accessibility is a good place to start thinking on Universal Design principles. http://www.accessiq.org/news/news/2014/03/why-document-accessibility-and-pdfua-matters (Accessibility btw is used in disability lingo to refer to stuff accessible to disabled people as well as non-disabled on an equal basis - not just run of the mill accessibility)  
Ethically I am against government using paid proprietary software where FOSS alternatives exist. Which is why I was pleased to see UK's official adoption of the open document format  recently. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/23/uk_government_officially_adopts_open_document_format/
Can PDFs be made accessible? Yes. But I'd go with the sentiment expressed below via http://datadenkers.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/the-united-nations-and-its-pdf-ghettos-supposedly-open-data-and-the-lack-of-transparency/:
What is clear though is that frankly, there is no reason whatsoever, why ‘open data’ would ever be ‘released’ in PDF format, instead of .csv or .xcl. As Nathanial Manning puts it: “This is like funding James Cameron to make Avatar, and then releasing it in a black and white flipbook. We are missing all the good stuff.”

Tim Barnes Lees framework on the 'degree of open-ness' of open data is perhaps relevant to this discussion.



1 Star
Data available
  on the Web, with an open license, but non machine readable - E.g. Zip files
  and PDFs


2 Star
Data
  available in Machine-readable proprietary formats e.g. Excel


3 Star
Data
  available in machine-readable, non-proprietary formats e.g. XML, RDF, JSON or
  even CSV


4 Star
Data
  Available using an open linked data format (URI so people can point to your
  data)


5 Star
Data
  available and linked to other data ( to provide context and relationships)

I am not a tech expert - but seems that there is a lot of activity around moving much of data from '1star' to the '5star' level - and that could be one guiding thought for us as a group.

India’s Media — Missing the Data Journalism Revolution?How can media make sense of a country that has over 1.2 billion people (about 17 percent of the global population), close to 800 languages, an electorate of 814 million, and the largest urban agglomeration in the world?
How does one plan for a country where, at the end of 2012, about 22 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line (with a daily spending of less than about US45 cents in rural India and US55 cents in urban India), but which also has 89 billionaires and features fifth in the Global Rich List? The country's latest Census in 2011 was taken with the help of 2.3 million enumerators travelling to more than 630,000 villages and more than 5000 cities. Census officials counted the thousands of homeless scouring footpaths and railway stations, while managing to include even the lone surviving Pakistani terrorist behind the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.

The article I find to be pretty interesting.  I agree more data that is actionable, can be used it is a necessity to help build capacity and skills in news rooms.  Also just pushing for data journalism is a short sighted ask.  Investigative journalism needs to be pushed also.  
I think there is plenty of interest in getting facts and moving the media coverage in that direction.  Whether we can pull together and make it a realty is another question.

No one can deny the role of investigative journalism but at the same time its equally important to have data backed journalism. In fact, data journalism can actually complement investigative journalism.
So on this note, I would largely agree with the article. I have a few friends in media and have been talking to few journalists personally. There is so much focus and pressure on the journalists for ""breaking stories"" that they patience, time and effort required for data journalism is  just not there. Add to that the fact that most of the journalists are not skilled enough to extract the required data from various sources in an efficient manner. I am not sure, but I have heard that some workshops are planned across the country to make them aware of some basic scripting (and other required) knowledge so that they can extract basic data themselves, I don't think there is an industry-wide push in that direction.

I also am weary of waiting around to see how sites like ProPublica and others find ways to become sustainable financially. The pressures and lack of capacity are in newsrooms all over the world including the west. 
India is the rule not the exception.This is not just a problem with Indian journalists and that means there is a great opportunity to experiment and find new ways to work with them and others to find different ways of promoting investigative and data journalism.

1) We can start with the Expenditure Budget presented along with the Union Budget 2014-15. 2) Eventually, we can also try some State Budgets that are available online which are almost always in pdf format. 
We can work on visualisations for budget expenditure in the social sector. Maybe look at specific schemes in Health and Family Welfare, Education, etc.As far as the budget for smart cities goes, you'll find

I guess this will make it easier for people from CBGA to join in as well (who can help us a lot to read through the budget datasets).
As for the budget datasests, as the new expenditure table (Union Budget 2014-15) are yet to be available in spreadsheet formats, should we instead work with the 2013-14 sheets (they are available in .xls format at <data.gov.in>)?
Thematic focus on expenditures in social sectors sounds good. If our exercise can tie-up with something CBGA is already doing, that will also be fine.


Let us keep the pdf-to-csv exercises for the next meet-up, and focus this one on understanding budget data, visualising that, and finding out what all data is missing (or not readily usable), so that we can make request for that through <data.gov.in>.


Is that alright? Please feel free to suggest other possibilities.From a brief look at <data.gov.in> datasets, it seemed to me that most of them are available at a highly aggregated level. This is surely something we can try to address, through data requests and by speaking directly with NIC and other ministries (as possible).

1398,Vaishnavi Jayakumar (Inclusive India),#topic/datameet/Px9PeekggpU,4,2014-08-11 03:35:00,Re: [datameet] Re: Seeking crime in Tamil Nadu 2009-2013 data,"Hi Sachin & Nisha,Thanks for responding. Had tried the Crime Info programme but it seems to be only till 2010. (It also needs a heavy duty comp to run it, my poor desktop running on XP kept zoning out!) And with all the claims flying back and forth regarding recent trends in juvenile crime being little more than hearsay, I was requested to numbercrunch last 3 years.
Even with that the data can be very misleading - anyone in conflict with the law invariably has at least 2-3 cases filed against them, only one is reported. So if a rape leads to murder it appears as murder in NCRB. Similarly some of the sections are inappropriate / bizarre for people under 18 years yet they are unfailingly reported. And the red herrings caused by elopements being categorised by irate families as kidnapping and rape only muddy things further.
Is there no way an intervention can be made by Datameet for more meaningful data especially as NCRB is gearing up for such a change? It's not like any options exist to pick and choose based on quality. This is our only source - it shouldn't be this half-baked!

It will be a 3-4 hour meeting beginning around 2:30-3:00 pm, and we will all work with datasets related to the recent Union Budget, trying to understand, analyse and visualise it.Some planning, however, is needed for the event.Firstly, we need to find a venue. It should have wi-fi and space for 15-20 people to sit comfortably. Possible venues include Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (Sadarjung Enclave), Center for Knowledge Societies (near Chhatarpur), and Youth Ki Awaaz (Green Park). Rohith, Namrata and Guneet, can you please check and confirm whether the respective venues will be available and suitable?Secondly, what datasets will we work with at the meeting? Rohith (CBGA), can you please take the lead in this discussion?Others, please feel free to suggest. If you are already working on something that includes (or needs to include) analysis of budget 2014, we can surely engage with that topic in the meeting. For example, I am quite curious to know what budget allocations are being done (if any) to build these '100 smart cities' that kept getting mentioned on media, or more broadly, how investment for urban infrastructure and housing is restructured (if at all) in the last budget.Bests,rijusumandroajantriks.net"

Something like we did before the Bangalore Open Data Camp around PDFs and QGIS.  2 to 4 hours where people can work on helping get data out of websites, pdfs, clean up data or learn or trouble shoot. 
We can pick a Saturday or Sunday, have food provided and get some specific tasks from people who need help.Is this something people would like to try? Also this would be separate from the DataMeet ups which we would keep as talks or presentations.

Introducing the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network (OCSDNet)
We are pleased to announce the launch of the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network (OCSDNet) and the public Call for Concept Notes on case studies that explore the linkages between open science and development initiatives. 
With funding from Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC), OCSDNet is jointly coordinated by the Centre for Critical Development Studies (CCDS) at the University of Toronto Scarborough (Canada) and iHub (Kenya). OCSDNet aims to support researchers and practitioners from the Global South to carry out research or projects that will lead to deeper understanding of whether, and the conditions under which open knowledge production processes could lead to development outcomes, such as economic and educational opportunities, improved health and food security, and policy reform. By contributing to this new area of study, OCSDNet will also build a community of open science practitioners and leaders who will influence policy dialogues pertaining to the role of science and innovation in development. 
 
Research Focus:
 
OCSDNet aims to investigate a broad range of questions, including:

How do researchers in various institutional contexts practice “openness”? How can open science approaches benefit researchers in the Global South?

Will OCS lead to novel insights and solutions to entrenched development problems? 
Can greater participation of citizens in the planning and conduct of scientific research increase its application in addressing local development goals?

How can the sharing of knowledge as a public good be weighed against protection of various forms of rights?
 
To explore these and related questions, OCSDNet will provide funding support for up to 15 case studies from eligible countries. Specifically, OCSDNet will support case studies that employ innovative and transformative open processes to address a range of development challenges in Global South contexts. The network welcomes a mix of projects that include scientific research in a specific domain to generate new knowledge (i.e. food security, health equity, citizen empowerment, renewable energies, climate change impact), as well as critical research on ongoing initiatives, focusing on behaviours, contexts, challenges and opportunities enabled by OCS principles. 
Applying for OCSDNet Funding:
 
OCSDNet has launched an open call for concept papers for OCS development projects. The call is open to researchers and practitioners affiliated with organizations based in countries that are eligible for support by the IDRC. The deadline for submissions is September 8th, 2014. Successful authors of the papers will be invited to a proposal development workshop, to be held in Nairobi, Kenya in October 2014. (For details of the call, visit the OCSDNet web site: www.ocsdnet.org ). 
 
For further questions, please contact us at info@ocsdnet.org.

Subject: [BOAI] Â Applications to Attend OpenCon 2014 Now Open
To: boai-...@ecs.soton.ac.uk


Applications to attend OpenCon 2014 in Washington, DC from November
15-17 are officially open! Â Students and early career researchers can
apply now at www.opencon2014.org/apply. The application form includes
the option to apply for a travel scholarship, which will be awarded to
many accepted participants.

Organized by the Right to Research Coalition and SPARC, OpenCon 2014
is the student and early career researcher conference on Open Access,
Open Education, and Open Data and will be held on November 15-17, 2014
in Washington, DC. The meeting will convene students and early career
researchers from around the world and serve as a powerful catalyst for
projects led by the next generation of scholars and researchers to
advance OpenCon's three focus areas

Applications will remain open for 3 weeks--until the end of the day on
August 25th. However, we strongly encourage you to apply early.
Acceptance decisions will begin to be made immediately, and if you
will need a visa to travel to the United States, an early acceptance
decision could give you more time to successfully apply for a US visa.

We're also excited to announce our first OpenCon 2014 speakers,
including Dr. Philip Bourne, the Associate Director for Data Science
at the United States National Institutes of Health, and John Wilbanks,
the Chief Commons Officer at Sage Bionetworks and 2012 TED Global
Presenter. You can find more details on the program at
www.opencon2014.org/program.

Cheers,

30 July, 2014
  
Dear Thejesh,
Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore invites you to the third edition of the IIMB Policy Hackathon on the 9th and 10th of August, 2014. IIMB Policy Hackathon seeks to use analysis and coding skills amongst the larger public to generate ideas and tools for better governance and to develop more relevant public policy. It provides an exciting opportunity to contribute to innovative solutions to public policy challenges and even win a prize for it. 
We have two parallel hacking events this year:
The Policy Hack is a team event focused on developing data based policy responses to a policy issue. Participants are given access to a nationally representative dataset (e.g. Census of India, National Sample Survey Data, District Level Health Surveys, etc.) and have 24 hours to identify a policy challenge and develop a data-based solution to it. Participants are required to analyze, code, and offer data based solutions to policy challenges in a 5 page document.
The App for Governance is also a team event where we look at developing technology tools (web portals, mobile apps, and in general, software solutions) that seeks to leverage information from ordinary users that is crowd-sources to strengthen governance and public service delivery. Participants will be given a problem statement that poses a significant governance challenge at the start of the App Hack and will be expected to develop, in 24 hours, a technology-based solution to address it. 
Timeline:
2-2:30 pm, 9th August 2014    : Team Registration
3:00 pm, 9th August 2014       : Teams begin Hacking
3:00 pm, 10th August 2014     : Teams submit their work
2:30 pm, 12th August 2014     : Top teams present their work
12.00 pm, 13th August 2014   : Winners Announcement & Prize Distribution
Registration: 
Participants may register in teams of 3-4, or register as a solo participant and join a team at the venue on 9th August. There is also the option to pre-register by writing to cppcon...@iimb.ernet.in. There is no fee for registration.
Prizes for each event:
Winner: Rs. 40,000
First Runners Up: Rs. 20,000
Second Runners Up: Rs. 10,000Shortlisted teams will be invited to present at the conference. 
The event starts on 9th afternoon at 2:00 pm and ends on 10th August 2014. Please spread the word in your networks and join us on Facebook.[1] If you are interested in participating, please pre-register via email with the following details:

I have not read National Map Policy but the above paragraph is very generic and worrisome. 
I will spend sometime this week reading the policy and update the list.

This is somewhat a known issue.

The thing is that, we should worry only when we have vital points and
defense installations mapped. Also, what Google did was completely
insane to SoI because thousands of people visit their maps everyday.
It's popular. OSM isn't, at least for now.

I'd say not to worry about this too much.

Having said that, in my opinion the Survey of India is not oblivious of OpenStreetMap and its activities in India. They are of course more concerned about Google. As I interpret the Map Policy, it will require anybody to take permission from SoI, which Google clearly didn't do. I believe there are other instances where SoI has permitted mapping by private entities as long as they kept away from the sensitive areas and installations. 
Even in city master plans these are separately notified / as good as being masked. A decade ago, when we ordered remote sensing data from NRSC (then NRSA), defence areas were masked clearly raising more eyebrows. We had to work with this data anyways. 
As long as OSMers are keeping away from the sensitive areas/installations there is little to worry. Perhaps, I would request Arun Ganesh give some gyaan on this, as Sajjad mentions this has been raised at times on OSM mailing list. 
Going forward, we can be hopeful that DST/SoI will be able to accommodate data generated from OSM. Aside, there is a paper that points out that accuracy and updated information is better from volunteered geographic information (VGI; aka OSM) as a against maps produced by Ordinance Survey.

With OSM all the data is universally accessible for the authorities to check and track, so should not create the same level of concern. 
Worst case, OSM is blocked in India by the Govt as an illegal project. But even that is not going to stop anyone else around the world mapping anything in India visible on satellite imagery, including sensitive areas. So in effect the rest of the world will have access to more detailed maps of India than its own citizens which will be counterproductive.
One can only hope the govt embraces the project in a constructive manner than do something silly like that above. And for all practical purposes if we stick to surveying only public areas, no one can be accused of revealing secret information.
With all the buzz happening with open data and the govt interest on the same, it would seem a formal resolution on this issue is imminent.--

I see this news nothing more than a question of massaging the ego!

A quick look at 'Bhuvan', a project by the National Remote Sensing Centre,
airforce fields & nuclear power plants were clearly visible. A direct name
search did not yield any results, but looking up via the co-ordinates found on
wikipedia, locating them was very easy!

So long as strategic locations of missile launchers is not in the knowledge of
the general public and not mapped on any public map, all should be good. Rest of
the installations are big enough for people to not know &/or notice.

Has the OSM community attempted contact with SoI? I have tried to get someone to come to a DM or ODC but it has been difficult.  Maybe you all have been more successful?Nisha

1456,srinivas kodali,#topic/datameet/6gqQ07MHaTk,1,2014-07-28 13:10:00,How secure is our Govt. restricted data?,"Hi all,
This is quite a debatable topic with all the recent revelations about snooping by the governments. Now the major question being, is the govt securely storing information? 
Everybody gives ""National (IN) Security"" as a reason when we request data through RTI, NDSAP hypothetically classifies data into restricted & open-access. We know that most of the open-access data is highly unstructured because we tried getting it open.
Now, how secure is the restricted data? Is it being encrypted? Here is an extract from NDSAPc) Restricted Access 
 Access to the following categories of information, in case these are not already in 
public domain – are restricted: 1. Exact coordinates of strategic locations; sensitive archaeological, cultural 
and historical locations; 2. Information about persons in terms of protection of data privacy 
3. Protection of intellectual property rights 
The data users who are accessing / using this data for research should clearly acknowledge the ministry / department in all forms of publications.
Now, there is thread by thej about sensitive geographic data being publicly available over google. Go google loksabha, you can get exact coordinates of it. If an associate requests bus stops lat longs from a regional transport agency, the reply would be ""Sorry, this information is restricted, because of security"". To be frank they don`t have it, but they are too proud to acknowledge it and take help from us.
Here is a railway site, in which any intermediate programmer can by-pass the so-called captcha http://www.indianrail.gov.in/pnr_Enq.html . Now what a hacker can do? he can probably get the entire site down
These are just publicly available data, we all know how delhi metro cctv feeds got leaked (sorry distributed for money). NIC issued fake google certificates two weeks ago. 
Now think of UID data being leaked, this holds data about every individual in the country. Frankly electoral rolls released to public should have anonymised data (i don`t want everybody to know i have un-married daughters in my house). I don`t want my identity to be stolen. If anybody wishes to sue EC over this, i would be very happy.
Is the NIC/India actually equiped to tackle a cyber-warfare scenario? We need a revamp of the data policy and security checks,measures. I don`t mind the govt snooping on me as long as it doesn`t release it to random advertising agencies.
Regards,Srinivas

It's one of the best things in the world.If the original source you mentioned is Bhuvan, then the files came directly from Survey of India. I have used those files before, and as you mentioned there were only some 2000 Odd features in it.
There are not from any specific era. Some tehsils in the file were created post 2001, while others created in the 90's were not present.The only exhaustive source I know, is the Census Administrative Atlas. They have maps in PDF format, not in shapefiles, and I had used it to create the district shapefiles which are shared on the datameet github repos.
Sometimes I feel I should get started on digitizing those pdfs. It shouldn't take more than 40 hours. Regards,Devdatta Tengshe"

I thought the files originated from the Survey of India, but wasn't certain.  I started to create a villages dataset, but the tehsils do not really align with what the 2001 census villages state their respected tehsil parent is...  So I am assuming all of the data from the gevernment is a mix bag (spelling may be off, codes may be wrong/ outdated, data may be mixed between years).  What a mess!?!?!  As per rectifying and creating maps based off the PDFs, I'm not sure I would do that.  The lines they have for boundaries are very, very generalized.  Also, I tried (a few years ago) to line them up with actual vector data, and there is a huge shift (i was using WGS84 vector data, so maybe I should have reprojected).Maybe it would be best to start top down or bottom up.  So either build a dataset from villages up to states or states down to villages.Thoughts?  We need some official data though (which seems impossible to find...).  But anything is possible, right!?!Cheers,Justin"

As you have found out, the boundaries of different Administrative levels do not match. There are many reasons for this, and not all of them are solvable.
The boundaries in the PDFs are generalised no doubt, but if one takes care while digitizing at the correct scale, one shouldn't have much problems. See the district shapefiles on the github repo. They were made from a top down procedure. I used the PC boundaries for the country and state boundaries. The individual district boundaries were made by referring to these very Census maps, as well as tehesil boundaries. I also used an custom tool which I have developed, which helps in cutting one polygon based on another polygon, which tremendously cut down the time I spent on creating these internal boundaries.So while the district boundaries might be generalised in some cases, that the best, updated shapefile I know of today.
Having worked with government departments, I have learnt that getting data itself is a big task.Any data is a boon. And once I get the data, I don't expect it to match anything else. With this paradigm, the Census maps are a goldmine for me.

Not necessarily. But you had to tell the join operation to keep the records without matches as well.

it would be Nice Confluence , reminds me of Freed.in  ,  my only concern is genX does not like too much of diversion they are ok with a python talk but when you talk about promotion or real leg work they shy away , which includes socially meeting in large diverse groups .
apparently  this meeting could easily  be mistaken for one  , so in order to make this idea/meeting a memorable one  , somebody need to iron out the agenda and do bit of moderation and time keeping. So that everyone can be heard .
yes i am for these kinds of meetups , what would we call this Confluence  , may be  !

Friday, July 25th does not work for me, but Aug. first week is fine.
Also, we should plan on more frequent meetings, and it should not
matter who is/isn't available for any particular meeting. The group

Boundaries are rarely clean straight lines. The official boundaries as of today have their origins in different eras.  Right from the boundaries of historic princely States, to the partition, to linguistic reorganization of states, all of them have contributed to the boundaries that you see today. 
There are many enclaves and disputed territories at village, tehisil and district levels all across India. Some can be seen in the mp-up border, some in hp, others in rajasthan, as well in the northeast. 
Whether you keep them or remove them from the data is up to you,  but you as well as others who use this data,  should be aware that they exist on the ground. 
Regards
Devdatta

Subject: About having a mapping party in Koorachundu Village Panchayat - Kozhikode district - Kerala - Reg.To: OpenStreetMap in India <tal...@openstreetmap.org>
Hi,    I am Jaisen Nedumpala, roaming here for quite a while as a contributor of OpenStreetMap, mainly focused on the mapping of Kozhikode district. Right now, I am working as the assistant secretary to the Koorachundu village panchayat, in Kozhikode district.
    What I am going to describe here is not purely a community issue, much related with my official duties too. But a village panchayat itself is a community, which:    1. enjoy an official status,    2. have its own powers and duties,



    3. full legal recognition and    4. authority over a defined local geographical area.    So I think, it might not be wrong to raise this issue here, in the hope that, this would be considered as an act of goodwill.
    Here we have an immediate requirement to map the village panchayat area, that might be helpful for the panchayat elections, which will be held in the year 2015. After the elections this map would be the base map for all the future practical purposes.
    State Election Commission (SEC-Kerala) realises that, systematically prepared maps can be used as a base map for administrative, scientific and academic purposes as an official document. Such a map would be useful as a base document for future delimitation of wards or bifurcation of Local Self Government Institutions. So SEC-K has issued an order to prepare maps for all Local Self Government Institutions of Kerala, which is available here in this link:
http://lsg.kerala.gov.in/news/files/More_Details_352.pdf(Language: Malayalam.)As per the order, the duties are assigned as follows:
1. Prepare maps for village panchayats, municipalities and municipal corporations (Local Self Government Institutions - LSGIs) with their external boundaries and mark geographical and man-made features such as small and big rivers, streams, roads, forests, raliway line etc. in those maps. Then pass down these maps to the LSGIs. The maps for village panchayats will be in A3 size (municipality: A2 size, municipal corporation: A1 size) and in defined scale, both in hard and soft copies, and will be issued to LSGIs within 15/07/2014. --Duty assigned to the Department of Survey and Land Records.
2. After obtaining the map from the Department of Survey and Land Records, The engineer in charge of public works at the LSGI, should draw the existing ward boundaries (which were fixed in 2010) and notable geographical marks, under the supervision of secretary of LSGI, after field verification. This job should be done within 29/07/2014 (within 9 working days after receiving the maps from Survey and Land Records) in case of village panchayats. --Duty assigned to the secretary and Engineer of LSGI.
3. After obtaining back the map with ward boundaries and notable geographical marks from LSGIs, the Department of Survey and Land Records will prepare the final maps of LSGI within 12/9/2014 using AutoCAD software program. --Duty assigned to the Department of Survey and Land Records.
Main Points to note:----------------------------1. LSGIs should have a systematically prepared base map for administrative, scientific and academic purposes as an official document. Such a map will be useful as a base document for future delimitation of wards or bifurcation LSGIs.
2. To become authentic, it must be prepared by the Department of Survey and Land Records, after receiving the official inputs from the LSGI authorities.3. The maps for village panchayats will be in A3 size (municipality: A2 size, municipal corporation: A1 size) and will be in defined scale. 
4. Department of Survey and Land Records will prepare the final map after obtaining the inputs from LSGIs, using AutoCAD software program.Problems I could see:------------------------------1.    KILA and SEC-K jointly published a hand book covering LSGI elections and related subjects, originally titled in Malayalam, which can be translated as ""Good governance through legal awareness - Hand book for People's Representatives and officials at LSGIs"" in 2013. In its pages no: 12 and 13, it is said that ward delimitation should be done using the cadastral map prepared and issued by the Information Kerala Mission, and if they didn't prepare such a map for a particular village panchayat, then that should be prepared with the help of Survey Department.
    In case of Koorachundu village panchayat, Information Kerala Mission didn't prepare a cadastral map, so we approached the Department of Survey and Land Records regional and district authorities long before, but any action is still pending.
    In the hand book, it says about preparing a cadastral map, but in the order of SEC-K mentioned above, the word ""cadastral"" is not there. No clue, what type of map would be issued to village panchayat, by the Department of Survey and Land records for this purpose.



 2.    If the map is meant to be useful for administrative, scientific and academic purposes, and be useful as a base document for future delimitation of wards or bifurcation LSGIs, I think, it must be a cadastral map. So I am doubtful whether the size A3 mentioned in the order of SEC-K is sufficient for this purpose. That is too small to include the necessary features in detailed scale, that to make it useful for any other practical purpose other than ward delimitation. Besides, the village panchayats of Kerala vary largely in their geographical area, the largest among them is Kumily in Idukki District, with a huge 816.73 Sq. K Ms size, and the smallest is Valapattanam in Kannur District with only 2.04 Sq. K Ms, and all the others lie somewhere in the range in between. How it is practically possible to make the maps of all these village panchayats in A3 size and at the same time in a defined scale? No idea. And it seems to be hard to draw all the ward boundaries and geographical features within this fixed time-limit, in a detailed and accurate manner for this relatively large village panchayat (Area: 72.74 Sq. K Ms).
    Cadastral map is a must, as we already suffered difficulties earlier when:1.    Using the watershed master plan, which was prepared without using a cadastral map, for the programmes under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act in village panchayat, 
2.    Asked for the panchayat level cadastral map to prepare detailed watershed based masterplan for Integrated Watershed Management Programme, but we couldn't provide it.    Let it be.    We couldn't prepare a panchayat level resource map for Koorachundu village panchayat, because we don't have a base cadastral map yet. So I think, it is high time to prepare one somehow, atleast in three themes viz. Assets, Land use, and Water resources so that it can be made useful for all practical purposes which may arise in the future.
    Continuous updation make a map an authentic source of information and possibilities of customisation make it reliable over time. Hard copy maps or raster images of maps have limited flexibility to update or customise. GIS or WebGIS is the best solution for this purpose. But, All the Local Self government Institutions (including village panchayats) of Kerala are restricted from preparing projects to develop a GIS or spend money for it, vide government circular available in the following link:
http://www.go.lsgkerala.gov.in/pages/fileOpen.php?fname=cr20131213_9208.pdf&id=9208(Language: Malayalam.)
    Considering all these factors, I can see more of less a deadlock condition here. Not expecting any relaxation in any of these orders/circulars within this fixed time limit. So I think about not a direct, but an alternative way to get mapped this area. OpenStreetMap would be the best solution at this point, I think. If all the necessary features here, are marked in OpenStreetMap, the geospatial data can be made available for any practical purposes including administrative, scientific and academic purposes at any time, using ETL techniques. Because I see many of the foreign academic/government firms make use of geospatial data from OpenStreetMap these days.
    Can anybody help us to map this area within 29/07/2014, if we arrange a mapping party here? Priorities to map are:1. The geographical boundaries of Koorachundu village panchayat.2. Existing ward boundaries (which was fixed in 2010).



2. Rivers and Streams.3. Roads.(No need to map railway line, because it doesn't exist here.)4. Forest area.5. Buildings which can be used as potential polling booths.6. All the ways/foot paths to those buildings.



7. Assets, Landuse and Water resources if possible within this time-limit.    Will this plan be accepted by the OpenStreetMap India community as a model?    If it is possible, then it will have a few advantages mainly:
1. It would be a learning experience for OpenStreetMap volunteers about this village community.2. Hopefully can arrange the help of Kudumbashree volunteers to map this area, and that would be a learning experience for them too on OpenStreetMap.



3. The OpenStreetMap volunteers will get an opportunity to explore the Koorachundu village panchayat, within which have some scenic places, reservoirs and streams.------------------------------------------------------



Koorachundu Village Panchayat profile------------------------------------------------------1. It is a hilly village panchayat, bordering with Wayanad district. 2. The headquartes - Koorachundu is 38 Kilometers away from Kozhikode(Calicut).



2. Well connected with all-weather roads (few nooks and corners are not, still), but public transportation facilities are limited.3. Population: 16111 (2001)4. Area: 72.74 Square Kilometers5. number of wards: 13.



6. Two major reservoirs (Peruvannamuzhi, and Kakkayam) and one dam (Kakkayam) are there in panchayat.7. The Kakkayam valley tourism project is in incubator. Besides Kakkayam, there are some other scenic places in panchayat, being a hilly area.



8. Broadband internet connection will be available at the O/o village panchayat.------------------------------------------------------Please do comment on this idea..--

of lines and rectangles put together in an adhoc fashion. It could be due to pdf generator libraries themselves. It feelslike the 'C' of this space. IMO we are missing the frameworks 
and higher levels of abstraction and/or representations. Theymay be available in the adobe ecosystem somewhere but itis not obvious to an outsider like me as to what they are. 
Hey Venkat, have you made any progress on this?Adobe formats are notorious for being hard to work with. In addition the original objective of PDF was display, not maintaining retrievable data hierarchy. So I have little confidence a single solution will just work for all cases.
Perhaps the way forward is to build a document parser that takes in a layout description in a domain specific language and tries to make sense of the PDF.

The PDF specification is huge, and parsing a PDF is no simple task.
We use Python, and have had decent luck with pdfminer for parsing
text PDFs. The documentation is a little sketchy, but one can find blogs
that describe how pdfminer can be used.

The government department involved in this would be the Department of

Business Division of the Postal Directorate that handles pin codes.

The public information officer (PIO) for the Mail Business Division is:

""14. Policy on Pin Code and Pin Plus etc. and their Popularization.""

Just wanted to remind about the GeoBLR Sprint tomorrow 6pm - 8pm at
the Center for Internet and Society. If you have spatial data/maps
problems that you would like to get help with, bring them along.

Some of the things that are in the pipe -
1. People want to understand Map Projections better.
2. What data should we focus on in OSM to improve Geocoding.
3. Supporting spatial data in applications like R.
4. A brand new and the very missing OSM app for Android.

I'm sure it's going to be great. If you have things in mind, respond
to this thread or let one of us know. More details -

I am a third year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur and a keen open sourcecontributor and data enthusiast. It is my pleasure to join the group the people
where everyone is making a good effort to bring more government data into thepublic.
I wanted your opinion on something. As I have noticed, whenever we have to
analyse something or present to the public users, the data collection (scraping,crawling) has to be performed by each developer individually. This is a time
consuming process and slows down the main portion of analysis and deductions.  Iwould therefore like to propose a project where we can develop a set of scripts
which would provide API for _generally_ required information which can then beeasily used by other developers. To understand more about what I am talking
about, please have a look at the @unitedstates group at github[1]. This would bevery similar and on the lines of this community maintained project, just that it
will be for India.
I am accompanied by other guys in my college to carry this forward. I would loveto hear your suggestions and ideas about this. If possible we can work this

Planning for a bangalore monthly meetup in the last week of July. I will announce the date and venue later.
I have started a meetup group for DataMeet, It keeps the email list clean. No RSVPs on email list etc. 
1. I have named the meetup as just DataMeet, May be we can have separate ones for city level groups. But as of now to start its just datameet, URL is
http://www.meetup.com/DataMeet
So join meetup if you like to meetup physically.
2. We make just the initial announcement of the list and blog. Rest of the planning of the meetup happens on meetup.com. And depending on the enthusiasm of the attendees we will have a followup note on the blog.

3. Suggestions are more than welcome. 
4. Also I want to propose a talk of mine for July meetup. ""Large scale telephonic polls - my experiences""

* The only introduction one should need is if there are mutual points
of interest :-)
* Our primary interest would be in an online interface
* A video can be (manually) generated from such an interface. As you
mention, there is a valid reason why one might want a video. But, I
will ask again my earlier question: Who do you think your primary
audience would be?

there are various options here, depending on what you want.

I am not aware of an official list of rural/urban constituencies as
such. But booths are classified as either urban or rural, at least on
the electoral rolls, and probably elsewhere, too. This could be used in
a simple counting game to see where more than a certain threshold of the
electorate votes in urban areas according to the official ECI definition.

If you are less interested in the official definition, you could try a
GIS-based alternative and overlay the polling booth point layer
(http://dx.doi.org/10.4119/unibi/2674065) with the MODIS rural/urban
polygon by NaturalEarth, which is quite accurate in terms of habitation
pattern irrespective of their official designation
(http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/50m-urban-areas/).

Best,
Raphael

I did the matching against MODIS data, but don't have electorate count
at hand, so no percentages of urban electorate population yet. But I am
sure you can take it further from the CSV here:

http://www.raphael-susewind.de/ruralurban.csv.tgz

This table shows rural/urban as well as ""urban rank"" (an indicator MODIS
uses for ""how urban is it?"") across India on booth level. Be aware that
not all booths are covered by the matching though (and some states,
notably Uttarakhand, are terribly inaccurate), so you have to aggregate
wisely.

For fun, I have also added a list of ""urban booth count share"" for
parliamentary constituencies, which should give you a very rough idea of
electorate share as well, since all booths are supposed to have a
similar number of electors in them.

Hope it is useful,
Raphael

nice to see you over here ;-)

This is not based on Census at all, bot on 2002/3 images of the MODIS
satellite, processed by NASA to classify land cover as habitated or not,
rural or urban (funnily enough, part of the criteria is ""light at night""
- they must have come up with something else for India though, at least
in UP there is no power at 3am ;-)...). As such, it pretty accurately
reflects the rural/urban divide in terms of physical geography a decade
ago - but not necessarily by GoI definition. Its a rough fix until we
get a nice, easily browsable list of the ECI's own booth-wise
rural/urban classification for 2014...

On Tonk and Sawai Madhopur: this is an odd slip-up in the AC-to-PC
conversion in my scripts, thanks for noticing. To correct, have a look
at the raw data in ruralurban.csv.tgz and re-calculate from the AC list.
In the meantime, I shall check what went wrong with the PC classification,

Best,
Raphael

Most important datasets like public transport, financial spendings, pollution levels, water  usage fall under state/municipal agencies. 
These are important datasets which need to be made public. Making local agencies release datasets through data.gov.in would bring data standards locally and also improve community participation. Think of it, bangalore.data.gov.in would be an interesting page to have.

  A Global View of Open Access – Part 6: A perspective on Open Access in India 
Tony Hey - Vice President, Microsoft ResearchI am very pleased to introduce the sixth and last article in this series of snapshots of the progress towards open access around the globe. Muthu Madhan, manager of Library and Information Services at the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Patancheru, Hyderabad (www.icrisat.org) has kindly updated his 2011 status report on: “Open Access to Scholarly Literature in India — A Status Report”. In this blog entry he reports on the recent developments on OA in India as well as summarizes its origins.
Open Access discussions began surprisingly early in India, dating back to a talk given by Stevan Harnad in September 2000. The first institutional repository was set up next year at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. Unfortunately, although the report details many expressions of support for open access, there have been very few institutional or funder mandates that have been implemented to encourage the deposit of the full text of research articles. ICRISAT is one of the few institutions that has set up a repository and introduced a mandate.
The situation seems a missed opportunity for Indian researchers but open access in India is complicated by the emergence of 100s of new ‘predatory journals’ claiming to offer open access for a fee. There is clearly much work to be done to realize true open access in India and it is to be hoped that OA initiatives such as that championed by the Global Research can help make a real difference.

now that Form20 results start to come out, some of you might be
interested in booth-wise elector count to be able to calculate
fine-grained turnout rates. They are not contained in Form20, but
available in the electoral rolls; as a side effect of my ongoing
academic work, I have extracted these.

Here is my pull request to the datameet github:

https://github.com/datameet/india-election-data/pull/8

Note that this is based on a quick-hack automated extraction, so no
guarantees. Also, some states and UTs are missing, notably:

Uttarakhand - PDF rolls not available
Chhattisgarh - PDFs rolls behind captcha
Lakshadweep - problem with parsing
Chandigarh - problem with parsing

I hope this is useful to some,

Best,
Raphael

Does anyone know what the license for these maps is?

One can use mapwarper.net to align the maps (the same tool as
maps.nypl.org/warper ), and get WMS feeds / GeoTIFF, etc. which makes
it super-easy to overlay on existing online maps, etc. once the
alignment is done. If anyone needs help with the tool, let know, have
worked with the developer, Tim Waters, and he'd be happy to chip in ..

There is also a budding Open Historical Maps project with a mailing
list at https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/historic and some
experiments underway at http://openhistoricalmap.org . It will be
great to have more mappers from India involved in the project.

Will be great to start having a common repository / index of indian
historical maps - once the maps are warped, there's some really fun,
beautiful possibilities for historical map visualizations .. let me
know if I can help out in any way.

Thanks for posting these!

This does not contain nor try to calculate any statistics it is base Data. But it makes easy and consistent for anyone to Calculate and share Calculations and Statistics. I intend to add more basic data especially about Candidates.Please check and let me know any discrepancies. Clarification : This data does not override any of the previous data, it uses it. Thanks to all the Data shared here on this group by different persons I am not naming them individually.Why This Dataset :Actually I did not intend to have this as the Goal. I down loaded the various dataÂ  and wanted to merge it with the Maps (Shapefiles).That is when I realised that the different Datasets can not easily be matched because of various reasons. The ID Codes were missing in some data. Exact spellings varied between earlier data and these datasets. Then I started doing research and ended up producing this.What does it contain : There are separate simple tables containing only relevant data without any information being duplicated (redundant)Â All table record have a unique Id and is linked to fields in other tables. I will detail about unique IDs in the later detail readme file. Most are obvious.these are the tables.Constituencies : All constituencies with some data directly in this tableStates : State codes and namesPolitical_parties : Complete list with my own codesCandidates : With codes using constituency code and rank. Not the ideal way. But in absence of Identity of candidate other than name this is good for the present.Geometry : Related to map. The most important information is about the Negative loops and Enclaves and Area.Votes : The votes polled by each candidate.Source : A. All the data available on this group.B. In addition I have two most important data from ECI for spellings and completeness and correcting. 1. http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/current/ListofElectedMembers_%20fromE-gazette.pdfGazette notification of the elected members. I found this to have least typographic errors hence this is the main base for changes.2. http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/ElectoralLaws/OrdersNotifications/year2014/EnglishNotification_12032014.pdfList of political parties from Election commission site. I have added the complete list in this and provide my own codes. What Changes : Mainly typographical, text matching, cleaning. Example : removed all double spaces, training commas. Unnecessary ""."" s. Replaced all ""&"" with ""and"" Eliminated all single quotes ""'""The details will be documented in final dataset. Output format :.mdb file since presently that is the only database software I use. May be someone can change it to an open data format..csv of all the tables.csv of an example query.What can you do with this : You can generate our own Queries easily change names as per your preference like ""Odisha"" and ""Orissa"" only at one place and regenerate Queries.Rgards Dilip Damle (New Delhi)"

As a result of this discussion, my understanding is that the facts itself are public domain. But their representation, be it in a news article, or a table published on a website/newspaper, can still be under copyright.
Let me quote from the linked article : ""As per the judgement, while the BCCI might have copyright claims over 
audio and visual recordings of the Cricket match, it does not have any 
copyright over information pertaining to the match, once it comes in the
 public domain.""So if you find a table containing some data, the data itself could become public domain(only under specific circumstances), but the exact representation of that data (i.e. that table) would still be under copyright.
We have several lawyers on this discussion list, and I'm sure they can provide a much better understanding of this, than my lay man understanding.Regards,Devdatta

If someone could edit the letter to take out all the Americanisms that would be great also :)Couple of important things that are very hard to find are:
- list of assembly constituencies in each parliamentary constituency- list of polling centers in an assembly constituency- list of polling stations in each polling center
- name of ward/mandal/taluk for each polling centerThe election commission appoints an officer for each polling center. So they clearly have information about the polling centers and list of polling stations in each polling center, but this information is not available anywhere for public consumption. 
Couple of the things listed above are available in various places, esp. the PDF voter lists. It would be very helpful and save a lot of time if this information is available in a machine readable format.

I belive open data science means, the code / technology / algorithms
used for data science are made open (via appropriate open source
licenses), via github or personal website / blog.

open data means, the data used for analysis is made open again via an
appropriate open source license.

So combining the terms won't make sense. The two terms stand for two
different things.

Just a quick thought that most of the algorithms / technology used by
all of us are open sourced by their respective authors. If they had not
opened up their work ever, we (esp. the self-learners) would have never
learn't a thing about data science! :-)

Doing it on the mailing list is a bad idea/etiquette.Apologies. But this was done on mailing list because we wanted the inputs only from the community on this list (rather random website user).

1753,Raphael Susewind,#topic/datameet/WUAlsx7kKbo,4,2014-04-10 23:14:00,Re: [datameet] Security Issues with the Voter List,"Hi Devdatta and Avinash,

yes, I, too, am frankly surprised at the ease with which one can access
sensitive data in bulk. Not only PDF rolls and voter details, but also
things such as land records, BPL lists, and much more - I think we are
in an exciting as well as dangerous phase of fairly uncontrolled,
nascent e-Governance practices. But I think the ethical issues here are
a little more complex than mere privacy concern.

Upfront, I must admit that I use all the above sources for academic
research (in UP and across India). What Avinash described in principle
and at the example of Delhi can indeed be done on an all-India scale,
and I am sure there are more people than just me who do it.

But then the social sciences have long dealt with sensitive data and
developed protocols to protect it. Even though the data is publicly
available, I for instance have my own copy on a secure workstation with
full disk encryption and two factor authentication. Whenever possible, I
also work on anonymized subsets of data. Yet there are other potential
uses - some of the more worrisome you pointed out - which are not bound
by such data protection standards.

To me, this once more highlights the nascent stage of ethical standards
around Big Data and eGovernance. On the plus side, I am happy to have
that kind of access to conduct research which will ultimately be
ethically beneficial, leading to better understanding of social issues
and potentially to better policy advice. Also, there is a point to be
made that transparency is an important asset in elections in particular,
not only in terms of individual electoral search functions, but also in
terms of publicly accessible (and cross-checkable, publicly verifiable)
PDF rolls. Finally, a lot of this data had been available in the past as
well, only in distributed and/or commercial form, which means there had
been a hierarchy of access: small-time crooks could not use it, but
large-time crooks were always able to use it. Likewise, scholars at
large (often foreign) universities were able to use it, but not smaller
ones (this is still true for some data, geodata in particular, which I
can only access because of Ivy-League contacts and only process because
of an association with Oxford University).

The ethical challenge as I see it thus comes not from data availability
per se, but from the bulk accessibility and processability of data, as
well as the potential to link otherwise disconnected datasets with each
other (for instance a voter ID from the rolls to the online electoral
search mechanism to that voter's polling booth locality to the ration
card of a person with the same name registered at a ration shop in close
spatial proximity to the amount of rice that person obtained last week,
all coupled - in case of my own research - to that person's religious
identity through a namematching algorithm). And this IS an ethical
challenge indeed, particularly if one leaves the ivory tower of
academia, where ethical standards for such data are more ingrained, and
more adhered to. One need not go all the way to the various criminal
uses of such data - are we all happy with commercial use, to start with?

I have no easy answers here, because I think the ethical issue is fairly
complex, balancing privacy and personal security against transparency in
the political process and legitimate academic use of data (also because
I think the answer must be found in India through political
deliberation, and not in German academia). Still, in the end, I have to
admit that I often leave my desk in the evening with quite some unease
over the sheer wealth of private data that I work with...

What do others think?

1754,Gautam John,#topic/datameet/WUAlsx7kKbo,5,2014-04-10 23:27:00,Re: [datameet] Security Issues with the Voter List,"Leaving aside my earlier comment as perhaps tongue in cheek, the
electoral rolls are *meant* to be public. The Registration of Electors
Rules, 1960 makes that clear. However, your larger point is well made.
Maybe what needs to be done is to *de-centralise* the storage? That
fulfils the requirements of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960
and making it harder to something like this.

It says: ""As soon as the roll for a constituency is ready, the
registration officer  shall publish it in draft by making a copy
thereof available for inspection and displaying a notice in Form 5--
(a) at his office, if it is within the constituency, and  (b) at such
place in the constituency as may be specified by him for the purpose,
if his office is outside the constituency ; [or in the official
website of the Chief Electoral Officer of the concerned State:]
[Provided that where such draft contains names of overseas electors,
the copies of such rolls shall also be published in the Electronic
Gazette 6 [or in the official website of the Chief Electoral Officer
of the concerned State].]

The Representation of the People Act, 1951 contains this: ""The
Government shall, at any election to be held for the purposes of
constituting the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of a
State, supply, free of cost, to the candidates of recognised political
parties such number of copies of the electoral roll, as finally
published ...""

Worth asking if we want political parties to have free access to it
but not citizens.
People Act, 1950 (43 of 1950)

But at the same time there are certain kinds of data which are not open ( i mean not open in a machine readable format) for a good reason. I believe voter rolls data is one such type. In the past voter lists have been used to pinpoint members of specific communities which were then targeted with gruesome effect. Shudder to think what happens if it is automated, a 'riot app'?
As Raphael points out this is not just about privacy, but could be much worse.This group is a fantastic initiative and as it evolves, it would be great for us to involve more social scientists and policy experts - so as we advocate vociferously to free more data and make it open - we can also bring in the technical expertise here to recommend where data needs to be better protected and how.

But i do think that certain minimum safeguards should be in place - even something as simple as a captcha code (and mentioned in the link which started off this thread), to deter heavy bulk downloading...it seems to me the bare minimum. 
Now, will this stop me from searching for someone specific within the voters list that i want to target, given that i have a rough idea of where they live? certainly not. Coupled with this is the irony, that other datasets for which there is absolutely no reason for secrecy (atleast i cant conceive of a reason for it - maybe its pure bureaucracy), are extremely difficult to get. Case in point is any official version of the PC, AC shapefiles which Raphael and others on this group have been trying so hard to create.
Raphael is right - these are complex issues. And we have barely begun to scratch the surface of what should be done. Interestingly, in the reddit thread linked above, there are references to the fact that  New York or Sweden too provide vast amounts of personal information for little or no fee...

1757,Raphael Susewind,#topic/datameet/WUAlsx7kKbo,8,2014-04-11 00:07:00,Re: [datameet] Security Issues with the Voter List,"Chandrashekhar,

just on the specific issues of targeting communities, which I have
thought about a great deal (my first book was on post-2002 Gujarat), my
tentative conclusion is this:

The fact that electoral rolls had been used in the past in riots before
they were available online shows that rioters, if they want to, can
access this data already. As Gautam pointed out, it IS public by law.
What changes is merely the scale of data availability. Large-scale data
would only be 'more useful' for large-scale targeting, however
(small-scale targeting is possible already), which I don't see happening
at this time (with the troublesome exception of Gujarat, particularly
troublesome now that Mr Modi runs for PM - but here, too, the targeting
happened in small units on the ground, even though coordination took
place higher up). On the other hand, fine-grained large-scale data is
absolutely necessary to understand a range of issues about (religious,
caste) economic position. So that in this specific case, we have
additional benefits but no additional risk (beyond the worrisome risk
already out there)...

More detailed arguments about this in a forthcoming paper of mine at
http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/2631138

Best,
Raphael

The UK approach seems to be a good one. In UK there are two voter lists - ""full list"" and ""edited list"". You can choose to be removed from the edited list during the time of registration or at anytime thereafter. The edited list is available in the public domain and the full list is safeguarded by purpose limitation and UK Data Protection Law.

thanks for the link - a discussion overdue.

After some discussion a few weeks back on this list, the ECI at least
introduced rate limiting to electoralsearch.in (though probably for QoS
reasons rather than privacy). Chhattisgarh is the only state with a
CAPTCHA to prevent mass downloading, while Uttarakhand does not have the
rolls online at all. Rolls for all other states are freely available,
though there are some technical challenges in terms of extracting data
from corrupted PDFs (but this CAN be done).

While I am happy to be able to use electoral roll data for academic
research, this commodification was exactly what I worried about from the
beginning. Let's hope ECI changes its access policies soon - though
arguably the damage is done, with an ""almost population register"" online
for long enough for all to scrape and use. But then privacy laws that
prohibit what is technically possible could at least limit damage.

My five cents,
Raphael

We really couldn't decide which to pick.  We narrowed it down to 9 of the best designed ones and are putting it up to the group to decide.We want to keep the logo decision to people on this group. So this is how this going to work.
1) Check out the logos at this link: http://datameet.org/wiki/logocontest2) Pick the logo you like3) Each logo has a corresponding number to left of it.  
4) Reply to this thread with the number of the logo. The logo with the most votes wins.  We won't count any votes that are not replies to this thread. The contest will close on the 20th of May. 
Thank you to the designers! Special shoutout to Anand Doshi for designing so many!We don't have a prize for the designer yet but we will think one up. 

We might edit the final logo slightly, but will keep the integrity of the overall design.Nisha and Thej-- Nisha Thompson

We might edit the final logo slightly, but will keep the integrity of the overall design.​My vote is for Number 6 with slight modification of making it bold.​

Given a choice, I would change it slightly to have the braces face each other, which would resemble two faces facing each other. Somewhat like the quick dirty mockup attached. Combined with the document D from the logo in 6, D}{ could also make us a good favicon. Something similar is used by superuser.com. Would be easy for quick uses too as it can be formed vt just text.

 Security Issues with the Voter List

Gautam John <gkj...@gmail.com> May 19 10:36AM +0530
        
      Something I read today:
 
http://www.medianama.com/2014/05/223-modak-marketing-election-voter-india/
 


Snehashish Ghosh <sne...@gmail.com> May 19 10:58AM +0530
        
      Dear Gautam,
 
Thank you. This is very interesting. I wrote a piece on this issue right
after the failed Google-ECI deal in February <http://goo.gl/e9Xea0>
The UK approach seems to be a good one. In UK there are two voter lists -
""full list"" and ""edited list"". You can choose to be removed from the edited
list during the time of registration or at anytime thereafter. The edited
list is available in the public domain and the full list is safeguarded by
purpose limitation and UK Data Protection Law.

Raphael Susewind <li...@raphael-susewind.de> May 19 07:41AM +0200
        
      Dear Gautam,
 
thanks for the link - a discussion overdue.
 
After some discussion a few weeks back on this list, the ECI at least
introduced rate limiting to electoralsearch.in (though probably for QoS
reasons rather than privacy). Chhattisgarh is the only state with a
CAPTCHA to prevent mass downloading, while Uttarakhand does not have the
rolls online at all. Rolls for all other states are freely available,
though there are some technical challenges in terms of extracting data
from corrupted PDFs (but this CAN be done).
 
While I am happy to be able to use electoral roll data for academic
research, this commodification was exactly what I worried about from the
beginning. Let's hope ECI changes its access policies soon - though
arguably the damage is done, with an ""almost population register"" online
for long enough for all to scrape and use. But then privacy laws that
prohibit what is technically possible could at least limit damage.
 
My five cents,
Raphael

      HI
 
YES, 
 
I think the way the Data access is provided gives transparency but it can 
be misused. 
I had downloaded Goa and Delhi pdfs several years back. 
 
Then explained to someone on a social network how he/she can be tracked and 
Stalked. 
PIPL.com can help you get complete name even if your name is hidden on some 
networks.
MTNL/BSNL Phone directory can get your number
Voter pdfs can give your address 
 
and this can be done on a mass scale. 
 
My opinion is they should make pdfs after Rasterising the pages in a kind 
of Odd and jaggered font 
So that they are readable by Humans but not easily by Machines

 Indian Elections 2014 - ECI Datasets

Dilip Damle <cadv...@gmail.com> May 18 09:02PM -0700
        
      Hello to all, 
 
Thanks for this data. 
 
I was wondering if there is a way to Uniquely identify the Contestant 
If someone wants to create a track record of the contestants over period 
then this is important
Just name is not sufficient. 
 
I tried to look for Duplicate Name&Party combinations
 
Including independents there are 97 duplicate combinations
Excluding independents there are 16
 7 candidates named as Chandu Lal Sahu contested  from Chhattisgarh, 
Mahasamund
Since they are from same constituency there are obviously different 
individuals. 
 
However there is no way to differentiate multiple persons with same name 
and Same person contesting in two constituencies.
Any way out?
 
Rgds
Dilip Damle

Can use the candidate_id from myneta.info . (also it includes S/O
information)
 


Chandrashekhar Raman <chandrashe...@gmail.com> May 19 09:48AM +0530
        
      This will be a tough nut to crack with just the name.. especially because
fielding 'dummy candidates' with same or very similar names is a fairly
common practice.. Used to split votes.. As employed by the veteran ajit
jogi in mahasamund.. Maybe eci will make some kind of identification number
mandatory in future, or they have already.

Nisha Thompson <ni...@datameet.org> May 15 02:03AM -0400
        
      Hey Everyone!
 
Before March's Open Data Camp we wanted a DataMeet logo and had asked
people to contribute some design ideas.
 
We were expecting maybe 1 or 2 ideas that we would adapt.  But were
overwhelmed by how awesome everyone on this list is and received almost 15
or so design ideas!
 
We really couldn't decide which to pick.  We narrowed it down to 9 of the
best designed ones and are putting it up to the group to decide.
 
We want to keep the logo decision to people on this group. So this is how
this going to work.
 
1) Check out the logos at this link: http://datameet.org/wiki/logocontest
2) Pick the logo you like
3) Each logo has a corresponding number to left of it.
4) Reply to this thread with the number of the logo.
 
The logo with the most votes wins.  We won't count any votes that are not
replies to this thread.
 
The contest will close on the 20th of May.
 
Thank you to the designers! Special shoutout to Anand Doshi for designing
so many!
 
We don't have a prize for the designer yet but we will think one up.
 
We might edit the final logo slightly, but will keep the integrity of the
overall design.
 
Nisha and Thej

      Thanks Nisha and Thej :D
 
I’ve used Pixelmator to make these, but it can export to photoshop too. Let me know if and when you need the files.
 
 
Thanks,
Anand Doshi.

      9. Hilarious! Needs datameet written underneath somewhere while people
puzzle it out! I get the pink-blue but perhaps a more attractive shade of
pink and blue may help overall attractiveness. Or use more quirky colours.
 
5. If it can be made less broad. Captures spirit of datameet perfectly!
 
Other stuff was very attractive but I guess I'm big on reading meanings
into things ;-)

      irrespective of which font/ design you might choose, also focus on the logo
colour. pfa a quick snapshot of the colour emotion guide. there could be
more on this subject which designers could also check before finalizing the
logo.
 
if this group is about people and data... then the people part (any thing
that connotes this) in the logo is missing
 
great work. hope this helps. cheers.

 Extracting address level data from OpenStreetMap

Raman Arora <rama...@gmail.com> May 15 11:08AM +0530
        
      I'm interested in analyzing address level data for specific sub-localities
using OpenStreetMaps.
 
Some questions that I have
 
1. Is it available to download a dataset in the form of a CSV file
2. Will it provide me with the associated Lat/Long
3. What is the extent of population of address level information on
OpenStreetMaps for cities like Mumbai/Delhi?
 
Are there any other available sources for India? (Similar to Royal PAF for
UK and USPS for the US?)
 


Sajjad Anwar <m...@sajjad.in> May 15 11:20AM +0530
        
      Hello Raman,
 
I'd like to suggest that questions related to OpenStreetMap should go
to one of the mailing lists there. Preferably, talk-in
(https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-in) or newbies
(https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/newbies)
 
OpenStreetMap uses several tags to store addresses -
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features#Addresses
I can't think of a single place where you can download a CSV from, but
you can extract it with some effort. For instance, I have just added
this query into Overpass - http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/3o6 (take a look
at the data tab)
 
Also, there's a project called http://openaddresses.io. They have just
started and it's covering only the US right now. But if you end up
fetching the address data, please consider contributing to
OpenAddresses. I'd be happy to help.
 
Cheers,
Sajjad.

 India Parliamentary constituencies lightweight version

Dilip Damle <cadv...@gmail.com> May 14 09:18PM -0700
        
      Hi, 
 
I am doing a checking of this data. 
I have found about 6-7 very small polygons missing in my data
This and any other corrections I will do today.
 
If anyone finds anything please let me know. 
It would be great if someone downloads and opens the file and tells if it 
works or there are some hitches.

Thank you for the lightweight version. I still found the converted KML
version of it a bit difficult to use in a Fusion Table; but I copied your
KML attributes to correct missing/ erroneous values for my own converted
KML (arrived by simplifying geometries of the datameet version by QGIS).

      HI Dilip,
Thanks for making the lightweight version. I have checked it, and except
for a few minor topological issues, there is only one major issue.
The Constituency of Mandi in HP is being repeated multiple times.
 
Otherwise it looks great.

Thank you 
 
I have already removed the duplicates, 
There was one more duplicate constituency 
 
There are some missing very small polygons which I will fix and then 
release again

 draft 2 of ECI Letter

Nisha Thompson <ni...@datameet.org> May 15 09:28AM +0530
        
      Hey All,
 
I have changed a few things from the first version. I put it up on the wiki
for review here:
 
http://datameet.org/wiki/odclettertoecidraft
 
It would be good to send it now since Elections are over and we can do
follow up with them.
 
Please add anything that you can think of.  Also if we can make a list of
suggested formats to add as an attachment.  I have added Avinash suggested
XML.
 
If someone could edit the letter to take out all the Americanisms that
would be great also :)
 
Nisha

Why XML?
 


Ashish Pandey <ashi...@gmail.com> May 15 10:18AM +0530
        
      Hi,
I don’t want to start a debate on format but looking at current/emerging technologies & format used by those. I would like to propose a JSON (java script object notion) format. which has number of advantages over XML format including being faster.

Thanks for making the lightweight version. I have checked it, and except for a few minor topological issues, there is only one major issue. 
The Constituency of Mandi in HP is being repeated multiple times.

The data that you are looking for is really interesting. I can't think
of any source, but you might find it in OpenStreetMap
(http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2018151). Look for
boundary=administrative and admin_level 4 and 3.

On the other hand, this is perhaps something that we can crowdsource?
May be from the 2011 census shapefile. If people are up for it, we can
coordinate it via Github or something.

The media channels come up with vastly different numbers and sometimes even random numbers. I wish someone on those various panels call them out on it but it never happens. Last time in 2009, some important constituency numbers - such as Sivaganga were shrouded in major controversy partially because news channels jumped the gun in announcing the winner, which turned out to be inaccurate. 
Besides, the news channels never come up with vote shares early enough. One good thing about the news channels and their websites is that the ECI site is relatively traffic-free because of the slight lag and slowness of verified updates.

      The article below screams out for a data visual!

      It would be great to see trends of daily highs/lows over the past
      couple of decades in B'lore. Number of days over 35, ...

      Also, as far as i know, Bangalore measures temperature in a cool
      place in IISc rather than a spot on MG Road (which is what people
      experience). Is that true?

      Can someone please help with getting Bangalore temperature data
      history?
      I have tried searching and the IMD website but found some averages
      (monthly), but not enough detail.

      Thanks in advance,

Activists name and shame heat wave
                  suspects


Bangalore
              Mirror Bureau | May 3, 2014, 02.00 AM IST
























































Soaring
                      temperature has triggered extensive debate among
                      Bangaloreans in the past few months. Despite the
                      claim by weathermen that the mercury levels are
                      well within the summer normal range, people are
                      experiencing intense heat across the city. Even as
                      many wonder what could have made Bangalore — a
                      city known for its salubrious climate — resemble a
                      boiling cauldron, environmentalists point fingers
                      at five major culprits. Nidhi
                          Yalburgi take a closer look


1.
                        WHOPPING REDUCTION IN TREE COVER

                      As per estimates by scientists at the Indian
                      Institute of Science (IISc), loss of green cover
                      has opened up the city to direct sunlight. Experts
                      are of the view that in each of the 198 wards of
                      BBMP, there should have been a minimum of 20 per
                      cent green cover. But currently, it ranges between
                      2-10 per cent, adding to the rise in temperature.
                      A decade ago, the city had 111 villages within its
                      limits, with lots of lung space dotted with large
                      trees, and natural depressions filled with water.
                      But rapid urbanisation has converted all these
                      into a concrete jungle.

2.
                        Disappearance of tanks/lakes

                      Bangalore was once known to have around 940 lakes,
                      but has around 200 lakes on paper today, though
                      many of them are nothing more than sewage pools.
                      Also, around 50-60 per cent of the city's economic
                      activity was earlier centred around agriculture
                      and horticulture. Experts believe that these water
                      bodies, to a certain extent, controlled
                      temperature levels by adding moisture into the
                      atmosphere. Today, many of them are just filled
                      with sewage and absorb more and more heat,
                      releasing greenhouse gases.

3. Glass
                        towers which create heat islands

                      Innumerable glass-fronted buildings across
                      Bangalore are also contributing to the high
                      temperature during summer. Such buildings are a
                      good fit in the city landscapes of countries in
                      the cold West. But when copied to an Indian urban
                      setting, they contribute majorly to the soaring
                      temperature. A study by green activists has
                      revealed that these glass buildings radiate heat,
                      creating heat islands across the city, which then
                      converge to raise surface temperature by 2 to 3
                      degrees Celsius more than the average.

4.
                        Metallic toys burn more than rubber

                      As automobile and vehicle tyres burn rubber,
                      there's collateral damage to the environment too.
                      As per the study, vehicles, along with buildings,
                      contribute to a 12 per cent increase in the heat
                      level per day. Heat from vehicle combustion, as
                      well as the mixing of sun rays with vehicle
                      emissions, adds to surface temperature. With
                      hardly any green cover to absorb this radiation,
                      the heat gets trapped in the atmosphere and is
                      circulated uniformly along the surface.

5. Lack of
                        open spaces and waste-burning 

                      Experts are of the view that open spaces within
                      cities would moderate the climate. Bangalore has
                      already lost several of its lung spaces either to
                      land sharks or illegal settlements. About 40,000
                      hectares of area around Bangalore is under
                      construction, though a third of it should have
                      been set aside to provide green cover.
                      Additionally, about 10-15 per cent of municipal
                      waste is being burnt everyday, releasing dangerous
                      hydrocarbons into the environment.



                      The actual victims of this mindless urbanisation
                      are the old citizens of Bangalore as they are
                      unable to cope up with climatic changes.
                      Large-scale radiation by buildings in the absence
                      of trees has increased the levels of ground level
                      or bad ozone, and hundreds of reports in this
                      regard have been quietly sidelined. What we need
                      is political will to tackle these activities.
A N Yallappa
                          Reddy, IFS (Rtd), ecologist 

                      Urban planners need to focus more on increasing
                      green cover at the ward level. Green cover at
                      every ward is important as it would balance the
                      heat radiation from buildings and other
                      structures. But unfortunately, afforestation in
                      recent times has come down drastically. Instead,
                      cutting of trees has become the order of the day
                      resulting in gradual increase of temperature.
Harish Bhat,
                          researcher and biodiversity expert

                      Developers and builders are contributors to the
                      agonising rise in temperature. The erstwhile
                      string of lakes would have cooled the heat wave.
                      But today, encroachment and draining of lakes has
                      almost doubled the temperature levels. The
                      situation is such that even rain water is
                      evaporated in a matter of few hours, owing to
                      intense heat at the ground level.

Eager to learn from and be connected with an international community of data enthusiasts


As a School of Data fellow, you will receive data and leadership training, as well as coaching to organise events and build your community. You will also be part of a growing global network of School of Data practitioners, benefiting from the network effects of sharing resources and knowledge and contributing to our understanding about how best to localise our training efforts.
You will be part of a six-month training programme where we expect you to work with us for an average of five days a month, including attending online and offline trainings, organising events, and being an active member of the School of Data community.
There are up to 10 fellowship positions open for the July to December 2014 School of Data training programme.
We have current collaborations and resourcing confirmed to support fellows from the following countries: Romania, Hungary, South Africa, Indonesia, and Tanzania. We are also able to consider applicants for the remaining 5 places in this round from countries meeting these criteria:


The country falls under lower income, lower-middle income or upper-middle income categories as classified here.


There is demand from civil society organisations and/or journalists who wish to benefit from such a scheme.


There are some interesting datasets available in the country which would be worth exploring further. These could either be data published by a government or organisation or data collected by an organisation for their own internal use. Digitised or non-digitised—anything goes! We’re keen for a variety of challenges and want the fellows’ help to adapt teaching techniques to a variety of situations.


Our goal is to have global fellows from a wide mix of these countries. Don’t see your country listed? Keep reading to learn how you can get involved!

All the layers of type GOOGLE_MAPS_ENGINE
And when you check the map viewer code, it creates an object of google.maps.visualization.MapsEngineLayer to display the maps, documentation of which is athttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/mapsenginelayers
With the following note:The MapsEngineLayer constructs tiles server-side and returns the tiles to the client. Use this class if you don't want to re-style the Maps Engine data on the client side.
I did check the response to confirm, here is one of the tile: https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.thejeshgn.com/img/screenshot/tiles.png
What we can do:On the same page using inspector construct DynamicMapsEngineLayerThe DynamicMapsEngineLayer (experimental) returns vector data to your client, along with the base map tiles. Your application can change the vectors' styling in response to user input or other triggers. (The DynamicMapsEngineLayer class is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below.)
And then on the client side download it.?? Not sure if this reverse engineering works. Its not a bad idea to try.

1888,Nisha Thompson,#topic/datameet/ml2UEmn5Ag4,1,2014-04-25 03:17:00,[IMPORTANT Group Business] Status of DataMeet - Please read til end- (sorry long email),"Dear All,The list has reached 760 people! 
Over the last 3 years what we have done:
3 Bangalore Open Data Camps2 Hyderabad Open Data Camp - This year they are planning one in June
Meetups in Delhi and Bangalore Scrapathons and HackathonsWorkshops
Freed some datasetshelped projects along the way- (Thanks for all your help with India Water Portal)
over 900 threads of great advise and sharing1 new group (GeoBLR) Gave the NIC standard recommendations <http://datameet.org/standards-for-data/>
There is probably tons of stuff I'm missing feel free to add things on this thread!
This is what we know about DataMeetData for a Civic Purpose - seems to be the common theme in all the topics we are covering.   
The group is not just developers and data scientists, a lot of new people are journalists, civil society members and just people interested in understanding the data world better.  It is an interesting group of people and I'm very happy to be able to participate in the conversations and sharing we have had here. But we are also ready to do more, and really move the open data culture forward in India. 
Over the next few months we will taking a look at the group and trying to figure out what king of structure will help us be more productive and help spread the idea of open data and building data capacity. 
As a Trust, it was agreed upon by Thej and Anand that we will not raise any institutional or programmatic funds til we (as a group) have discussed, debated and agreed to the By Laws, and those By Laws are then signed by the board.  
The exception being sponsorship funds and support for events and workshops.  However none of those funds will be spent on non events work. The Centre for Internet and Society has supported us by letting us use their address and paying for our registration fee.  
How will we do this?
I have quit my full time job at Arghyam to spend more time with this community and articulating the things we want to accomplish. 
I have set up a first iteration of the idea Market Place which will eventually be where we put our ideas and projects. Here:
http://datameet.org/things-to-do-or-talk-about/
I'll be adding a wiki page with all the ideas generated from ODC2014 and the list over the next few days.  So we can see them in one place and start to form groups of people and find other networks and partners interested in pursuing them.  This is our first step is organizing our thoughts and finding others.  
Then we can create a decision making process that will allow people to pursue projects and ideas in chapters and interested groups.  
Please take this thread to give feedback, thoughts, ideas, and volunteer to help us build out the website so it is more friendly for people to use.
Over the next week. I will be sharing my thoughts in order to keep the discussion going.  Also we will be populating the website with stories from why datameet was started and also sharing the thought process behind why we formed a trust. 
There is no set time period for how long we need to figure this out. Let's start the discussion.
Sincerely,
Nisha

Krishna Prasnth's plea for AC shapefiles made me decide to start pushing
mine out there ahead of time in draft form at least. I would have loved
to have them ready before the Bangalore hackathon, but  such things take
time and I am quite busy.

Still, here they come at last: draft GIS shapefiles of parliamentary
constituencies, assembly constituencies and polling booth localities,
published under an open license (CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0):

http://www.raphael-susewind.de/blog/2014/mapping-indias-election

Unlike the hackathon files, these were created using an automated
algorithm (described in the blog post above). I intend to release (and
long-time archive) them by end of the month, and would welcome comments
and feedback until then: if you are familiar with both GIS and a
specific state, it would help me a lot if you could have a look.
Likewise, comments on the general method are very welcome.

So far, the smaller states are online, but I will add more on a rolling
basis - computing takes a few hours per constituency (longer for the
larger states). I hope to complete the set by end of the week.

Let me know if you find them useful,

Best,
Raphael

They are using an excel file, instead of a plain text file, where one
might one would had semantics similar to any config file. Since people
with minimum programming language can use excel, they have used the row

1920,Raphael Susewind,#topic/datameet/VFgIadx4DC4,1,2014-04-17 03:53:00,Census village to polling booth matching,"Dear all,

I vaguely remember that some people are working on matching census
villages to polling booths, and wonder what progress they made. As some
of you know, I am currently doing this India-wide through an automated
spatial matching algorithm - but before releasing the result, it would
be nice to assess accuracy of this procedure more thoroughly.

The key problem I face is that polling stations are often not named
""village X"" but ""primary school founded by Y"" - so that name matching
does not help too much in validation (certainly not in urban areas).

It would be better to check against roll part names (thus my email about
those a few days ago), but best would be if anyone has a manually
matched table of polling stations (2014 IDs) against PCLN (2011) or MDDS
(2011) census codes with which I could compare my results - if only at
the example of one state, or a few districts.

Alternatively, if somebody has too much time too offer and is familiar
with any specific district in greater detail, I could send along a
matching table for this district to see how well it fits. Please get in
touch in a direct mail in this case...

Any other ideas how to validate the matching table welcome,

Best,
Raphael

New to the group, didn't find any prior discussions on Parliamentary to Assembly to Ward/Village demarcations. Hi Siddarth,
The voter list PDFs have the ward info for each polling booth. The PDFs have the number of voter, but not the population. So it possible to sum up those number to get a count of number of voters in a PC or AC.
If you want polling  booth to ward mapping, I'll be able to provide it.

I, too, am really interested in this, but have not made much progress
yet. I think there are two ways to do this, neither of which is
straightforward.

The ""extract ward/village mentioned in roll PDF"" strategy is one option.
Depending on raw data, this can however be cumbersome (one source in the
vernacular, one in latin script, etc); I know a couple of scholars who
attempt to do this and they are stuck all the time, having had to
manually match rather frequently (which is a pain given that there are
800.000 or so polling stations).

Currently, we have the additional problem that many of the current roll
PDFs - for instance in UP - are broken: one cannot copy-paste (or
pdftotext, or extract through whatever means) from them, chiefly because
the ToUnicodeCMap is corrupted by the version of CrystalReports the ECI
is using. There is no real workaround other than reverse-OCR, which is a
pain-in-the-a**. Let me know if you figure another way...

The second option would be a very different strategy, namely GIS
matching through next neighbour analysis: ""what is the closest Census
village/ward around that particular polling booth"" (or the other way
round - the computational challenge is to match ALL booths to at least
one ward AND vice versa). Unfortunately, Census village/ward lat/long is
not in the public domain, as far as I see - and using proprietary data
to do the matching is legally complicated (even if one redistributes
only the matching result and not the proprietary data).

My 5 cents,
Let us know of any progress,

Raphael

yep - thats what I figured, too. Not only misplaced matras (those could
be rearranged), but a real garbling, which cannot be resolved as far as
I see. Worse, there isnt even a clear pattern - for a few
constituencies, I fed the Voter ID (which is in latin script) to the
""search roll details by voter ID"" function on the CEO website, which
returns the properly written unicode name. I then compared garbled name
and unicode name to see if there are any statistical regularities - yet
unfortunately, there are a thousand ways of garbling ""Avinash"" - its not
always ""Abniszhaa"".

The only solution I can think of is the following (but I have not
implemented it): train TesserAct (an IndicScript OCR) with the exact
font used in the PDF reports, so that it almost perfectly recognizes
something written in this font (this was a stumblestone for me, rather
complicated work), then extract images of text areas of interest, and
run them through OCR. If you want to give it a shot...

Otherwise, we could only try to convince the EC to fix the bug in
Crystal Reports, and re-generate all PDFs - which is highly unlikely,
they have more important things to do right now (the PDFs display and
print alright, after all, just text extraction does not work - they
would perhaps even consider it a feature rather than a bug).

It might be useful to compile a list of states where this problem occurs
- I have seen it in Gujarat and UP for sure, but don't know whether it
happens everywhere,

Best,
Raphael

1954,Avinash Celestine,#topic/datameet/yrL-oaiG3Gc,17,2014-03-15 00:43:00,Re: [datameet] Parliamentary Constituency to Assembly Constituency to Ward linkages,"Re the issue of mapping of wards to AC/PC boundaries etc raised by Siddharth and the original subject of this thread, here's my two bits. warning, longish and extremely boring email follows! :
firstly, you might be better off using the delimitation xls files rather than pdfs. they are here:http://eci.nic.in/delim/paper1to7/finalpapers.asp
The delimitation papers map the AC and PC to census 2001 codes and boundaries. So its actually a two stage process - one, get the AC, PC census area/village/ward etc to line up neatly in a usable table or database, and
two. map the 2001 census codes to the 2011 census codesboth are non trivial stepsone, the census categories which are specified in the AC/PC delimitation documents do not map neatly to the areas in the census data files. In the first place, there are no census codes for individual areas in the delim docs making it that much harder. secondly, the level of aggregation across the delim papers and the census docs itself is different. To take UP for example, many constituencies in the delim papers are mapped to what in UP are called 'KCs' (kanungoo circles) or PCs(patwari circles). They do not go down further and say which villages make up those KCs or PCs. ditto with bihar and other states. The census tables on the other hand, have data about villages, tehsils, and blocks. they do not go into KCs and PCs. So theres often a mismatch between aggregation levels which will take work to resolve.
two. mapping census 2001 codes to 2011 codes. if you do that, the starting point is here:https://egovstandards.gov.in/mapping_land_region_codification (the site will throw a security warning in many browsers but i think thats because nic has not updated its security certificates or whatever. its not been a problem for me, but you proceed at your own risk)
this maps 2001 codes to 2011 codes. Here's the problem:for urban areas, the coding goes down to the town level. So there is one town code for the whole of mumbai for example, which maps 2001 to 2011. What you cannot do with this table, and which is a big problem for urban areas, is map wards which exist as of 2001 census, to wards which exist as of 2011. Many city municipalities have rejigged ward boundaries over the last decade or so (i know delhi has). So even if you can match town codes, you still need to match wards from 2001 to 2011. All this is less of a problem for rural areas though its still present to some extent. This problem also makes 2001 and 2011 census data non comparable at a ward level because, if I recall correctly, census 2011 uses newly delimited wards whereas 2001 will (obviously) use the old ward boundaries. 
If you are interested in only a specific city or area, here's a suggestion. bypass the delim papers altogether. Start with the pdf electoral rolls which are now online for most states. The first page of the roll for each polling station has a standard format which has the area and ward boundaries, the AC, PC data as well aggregate number of electors. Write a scraper to parse just the first page of each roll. Of course if you are doing this for UP, you are totally screwed, because as Raphael pointed out earlier in this thread, there is a problem with the pdf unicode mapping so you'll basically get gibberish. But I think that pdfs for other cities may be more scrape-friendly. I tried it out with a couple of pdf rolls for delhi as a test case, and it worked reasonably well. The ward data from the scrape should line up easily with the census data. hopefully.  
Having said that, I did take a shot at doing the mapping atleast to the census 2001 codes. attached is the result. this is an excel (within zip file) with about 54000 rows, of which 20,000 rows are 'not matched' for reasons described above, so its very much a work in progress. Different states have been matched to different extents. UP, Bihar have big gaps, - states like delhi and gujarat less so. A few more points :
* the left side of the table is from the delim papers, the right side is census 2001.* where the delim papers specify that only a 'part' of a ward or area are contained within that AC, i have worked out the proportion of the entire ward population that is covered, in the right most column. This column is not complete either.
A word about the methodology and my 'big breakthrough' :-)) in matching the two datasets even to this extent. The delim papers have population/Sc/ST data from the census. It struck me that given the district and state, these population numbers are actually a kind of unique identifier of their own. As in, the census population figure for village/ward (x) given the state and district, should match down to the last individual, the population figures from the census - in other words, exactly. So the matching field is some form of : statecode-districtcode-population total. This actually worked far better than i had hoped, though obviously not completely. As a cross check on the above, i re-ran the match, using state-districtcode-SC population/ST population. The possibility that two areas in a district have exactly the same total population and the same SC and ST population is, i hope, quite small. 
Anyway, I am hoping people can add to this ...The main caveat applies which is that the possibility of error is definitely there. So if you do use this for analysis, please, please, please do random cross checks. It'll take time, but it will save potential embarassment :-) and wrong data. And if you do find errors please fix and reupload.

using population figures for matching is a neat idea, great!

Meanwhile, I made both legal (licensing issues) and mathematical
progress on matching 2001 Census villages to 2014 polling booths. I have
a large conference next week which might delay things, but I expect to
bring out an open license dataset with the resulting matching table soon
after that. Of course, the matching quality with my strategy entirely
depends on accuracy of GIS data, which varies from district to district
(in some districts, the officers concerned clearly decided to photoshop
rather than visit each station, resulting in a neat artificial grid -
quite funny to see, but quite useless otherwise). Theoretically, one
could combine my algorithm with a fuzzy ""name proximity"" measure, but I
am not sure yet whether this will improve accuracy or just add confusion.

Anyways, it will be interesting to combine my approach with yours, and
with that of others going down similar roads.

Which still does not solve the 2001 to 2011 Census mapping of course,

For instance, if a village/area is near the border of a constituency, its possible through an order to bring it under the administrative jurisdiction of a neighbouring district. If that district is then served by a different AC, you have effectively done some delimitation of your own, without actually calling it that....
given that delimitation papers don't specify individual villages in many cases, it seems entirely possible to do...looking forward to your dataset, Raphael!

(Kudos to Avinash & Raphael and others for the efforts to mix/match AC-PC and administrative jurisdictions)..There is no direct containment of ACs within a district. Case in point is Delhi, where ACs dont' fit single districts at all. 
Avinash, Trouble with the kind of political delimitation that you talk about is that..it doesn't really serve any purpose. With cross-determination of powers at various levels - blocks, wards, districts under the bureaucracy vis-a-vis MLAs, changing administrative jurisdictions doesn't make much sense as much as doing direct gerrymandering for political vote-gaining. In other words, the powers of a MLA administratively is much too nebulous as compared to district officials across the bureaucracy and the third tier of democracy.

That sparked off the thought. I wanted to dig deeper. I thought that while one might disagree with the census definition of urban, it's a basis to begin with. Was hoping to look at all PC and AC with a % urban. > 50% would imply urban constituency (perhaps not the best method, but seemed like a good start)I guess it isn't as easy as I imagined, but still would be good to figure out.

1963,Raphael Susewind,#topic/datameet/yrL-oaiG3Gc,26,2014-03-16 02:24:00,Re: [datameet] Parliamentary Constituency to Assembly Constituency to Ward linkages,"Hi Siddhart,

for my UP dataset, I used spatial matching of polling booth locations
against the MODIS urban extent satellite layer of 2002 - tends to be
larger urban centres, though. Another option is to look at ""how many
polling stations have multiple booths"" [polling stations being defined
as booths with almost same name in almost same location] - this turned
out to be a rather accurate (and up-to-date) representation of the
""urban"" as well as ""small town"" - only real rural stations have only one
booth, in my experience (UP)...

Best,
Raphael

Unfortunately my tech skills are a bit sad so I will quietly cheer from the sidelines.Best,RukminiOn Wednesday, March 12, 2014 8:19:50 AM UTC+5:30, Siddarth Raman wrote:Hi All,In line with the discussions on elections, this is something I'd started working on a while back (and dropped). I was essentially hoping for a PC to AC to Ward mapping. As far as I understand, census 2011 has population data either at the level of the ward or the district, so if we had to run even rudimentary data analysis on a parliamentary or assembly constituency (like total population) accurately, I'm guessing we need to go bottom up.I had started this by attempting to convert http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/CurrentElections/CONSOLIDATED_ORDER%20_ECI%20.pdf into excel (using a mixture of pattern matching in notepad++ and a bit of excel vb). It's time consuming (largely because each state follows its own convention - not standardized)Any suggestions on how one might go about this? If I wanted to estimate the population in a parliamentary constituency, or the total households, or the urban/rural split, how would I go about it? Is there a better method than looking at the above demarcation notification? Are there datasets on this already?New to the group, didn't find any prior discussions on Parliamentary to Assembly to Ward/Village demarcations. Regards,Siddarth+91 7760631278Associate,Public Records of Operations and Finance,Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracysiddart...@janaagraha.orgwww.janaagraha.org "

If you are doing analysis for parliamentary constituencies, my guess is this should work reasonably well. It works less well if you want to look at assembly constituencies. What you end up with is effectively a weighted average, for each PC of the districts that it matches to. In most cases, we would anyway use only percentages (share of literate popn and so forth) rather than absolute numbers, so it works.
I updated the AC-PC to district mapping file that I uploaded a few days ago to correct for errors in two constituencies (PC no 33 in bihar, and one constituency in uttarakhand. I had duplicated them).
 In an additional sheet, the EC's elector information for the latest rolls, is given, along with mapping of district to AC. I suggest you use that rather than mine. Its more comprehensive, and is likely free (or atleast freer!) from errors that i made. (source of the data is here http://www.eci-polldaymonitoring.nic.in/erollpublic/). I matched in the PC names to that table. File is attached.

just a follow-up to this oldish thread: I recently switched to the
newest version of TesserAct OCR to transform buggy PDF rolls to text -
and it works surprisingly well. Small typos here and there, but that can
be rectified. In case anyone else looks for a solution to this...

thanks, I have the psleci data already (its the basis for my electoral
maps). As for the part names, I have looked around on the UP CEO site,
and found that the BLO detail search function contains both part name
and station name - but for an all-India solution, I will have to slowly
query electoralsearch.in I think - so that the rate limiting does not

Hi Anand,

short update: electoralsearch.in does return wrong part names (basically
they copy the station name field) at least for UP. So its back to CEO
sites...The other thing that I've realized is that it doesn't cover all the states (AP, karnataka missing). So it won't be of any use if you are looking for all-India solution.

there is a good comparison of CC vs ODBl when applied to data at
http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data

also, any specific reason to use CC 2.0? There are CC 4.0 licenses
already, arguably more developed (and also more suitable for data, see
link above)...

My five cents,

Just downloaded the data and went through it. Realize that these are the old parliamentary constituencies (pre delimitation in 2007-08). That is one possible reason this data might have been taken off the EC website. 
So yes, I promise beer to anyone who gets me shapefiles of new (post delimitation) parliamentary and assembly constituencies (at least for Karnataka).

I've attached my quick-and-dirty attempt here, and have overlaid the (pre-delimitation) EC assembly constituency shapefile that was dumped on datameet earlier. At both the georeferencing and vectorisation steps, there's a substantial loss of accuracy; at the georeferencing stage because the PDF map and the earlier EC data don't match up properly (there are kinks in one boundary that aren't duplicated in the other) and at the vectorisation stage the actual boundaries in the PDF are very thick, so they could be anywhere within a few tens of kilometres of their actual position. In the case of Bangalore city particularly, this image is unusable. Other potential sources I've tried accessing, only to discover that they
 also do not have access to up-to-date AC/PC shapefiles, are the Harvard
 Geospatial Library and CPR.I'd suggest that the only way of getting a useable version of the data is to get the EC to re-release it, ideally under the auspices of the National Data Portal. This is obviously easier said than done."

Neighbourhood Trees Campaign


Photograph, map, and share a story about trees











What : The Neighbourhood Trees Campaign is a nationwide event where participants will photograph, map and share stories on trees from across India.

When : From 22 - 27 April 2014

Why : The aim is to record the distribution of species across India. Checklists and distribution maps of trees can be valuable information towards protecting them. All observations, lists and maps are freely available for download under Creative Commons licenses and can be useful for research studies. Most importantly, it is a fun activity to do during this time of the year when many trees are in bloom!

How : It is simple, easy and a lot of fun. Grab a friend, take your camera, mobile phone or note pad; photograph and document trees in your garden, road, neighbourhood park, farms, forests, lake shores, river banks, etc. You can also join an existing local event or sign up to organize one here.


		Observe and photograph trees in your neighborhood.

		Head to http://treeindia.in and create an account.

		Upload your observations or lists with date, location and notes.

		Submit and share with friends!!

		Experts will help you identify unidentified species and confirm identified ones.

Browse, comment, agree on species IDs or help identify incoming observations.

2020,Avinash Celestine,#topic/datameet/up5yTy7U64s,1,2014-04-05 01:07:00,format for release of candidates assets/ criminal records data,"Hi allI recall there being a letter circulated about data requests to eci a few days ago. I had a suggestion about the format in which the ECI releases (or enables the release of), data contained in the  affidavits of candidates. I wasnt sure whether this suggestion fit into that, so i broke it out into a separate thread.
Right now, candidate affidavits are released in the worst possible format - pdfs - not just for those looking to do some in-depth analysis into it, but even for the journalist/voter who wants to know more about the candidate declarations.
I wondered if there was any possibility for engaging with the ECI over the longer term (obviously this election is out of the question) to change the format in which candidates must declare such data. They could be required to declare it in a couple of formats - one would be pdf of course, to enable those interested in a specific candidate. But the other format i had in mind was xml.
The best analogy i can think of to this, is the recent requirement by the ministry of corporate affairs that companies file their reports with the registrar of companies in XBRL xml format. The EC could require candidates to do the same - they could make it easy by providing a software (could be as simple as an excel application) which will generate the xml and the pdf as well. (the other analogy here is the online filing of tax returns, which requires an xml to be filed online)
The biggest criticism of any such change (that i can think of) is that poorer candidates, who don't have good access to a computer might find it extremely difficult to file this way. Perhaps there could be special facilities provided at the level of district electoral officer, to enable such candidates to make the filing.
Once the filing is done in xml, it would be easy to convert it into more friendly formats (for humans), such as excel etc.Anyway, that was my suggestion. Perhaps its possible to engage with EC in the longer term to develop the standards for such a format.

We can start with the Delhi Act (Haven't found the Acts for the other states where geospatial data is being collected).The Act is very interesting, as under Section 3 it provides for mandatory uploading of the geospatial data by ""every line department, local body, public authority, private and public agency rendering service of public utility in Delhi""Schedule to the Act, lists the line departments, and it is pretty extensive.Interestingly, it covers 'public and private agencies' a term defined under the Act to include electricity distribution , telecommunication, internet and the like. Further, under Section 3 the data is to be uploaded in real time.The company created under the Act is required to develop a revenue model for supply of the data, including citizens of India (Sec 6). Controlled access of the date is to be allowed to the public (Sec 8(3)).The departments have to certify quarterly that the data with them has been uploaded (Sec 10(4)).A regulatory authority and an Appellate Authority has also been created to monitor the geospatial data (Sec 16, 18, 19)I have not come across the Rules/ Regulations created under the Act.At the very least, I can call up and find out about the amount of work already undertaken.Question: Have you seen similar legislations in other states?Praachi"

GENERAL
ELECTIONS 2014:
LAUNCH OF
SPECIAL WEB-PORTAL AND REFERENCE HANDBOOK
 
New Delhi,
3rd April, 2014
 
As the
nation heads towards the General Elections to elect representatives for the
Sixteenth Lok Sabha, the Press Information Bureau has planned a series of steps
to disseminate information about this mammoth exercise.
 
A number
of factsheets, backgrounders and features have already been issued on various
aspects of the General Elections. The backgrounders cover detailed and in-depth
analysis of various aspects of past elections, with special focus on the 15th Lok Sabha Elections (2009 General Elections). State-wise
fact-sheets impart information on various states pertaining to electorate,
Parliamentary Constituencies, past elections etc.
 
Many of
the features have been contributed by senior officers of the Election
Commission of India. The features range from the topics like ‘Evolution of
Election System in India’, ‘Electoral Laws in India’, ‘Salient Features of
Representation of the People Act 1952’, ‘SVEEP- Tool for Voters Awareness’. New
developments like NOTA and VVPAT also figure in the topic-list and Guidelines
for media, Paid News, Opinion Polls & Exit Polls have also been covered
under features.
 
Today, PIB
has released ‘General Elections 2014: Reference Handbook’, a compendium on past elections and the latest provisions
relating to the general elections. Apart from English and Hindi, the book will
be made available in 11 regional languages, namely, Assamese, Bengali,
Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.
 
Simultaneously,
the Bureau has launched a web-portal, dedicated for the General Elections 2014: pib.nic.in/elections2014. This will be used for dissemination of important
instructions, orders and press notes of the ECI. The
Reference Handbook also will be made available on this portal. On Counting-Day,
i.e. May 16th, 2014, this portal shall also be used to disseminate
official trends and results, based on real-time data made available by the
Election Commission of India. These trends and results will also be shared on
social media, and through SMS.
 
Once the
results have been declared, this office will analyze the data of the Sixteenth
General Elections in detail, and a compiled version thereof will be released.

DISE collects an incredible array of data on all primary schools, public and private, in every state of India and have done so, year on year, for many years. The self-reported data contains variables that cover enrolment to sanitation to infrastructure and more and a full list of these variables can be found in the DISE DCF.

We believe that the data DISE collects is an under-utilised resource and have built this application to allow users to better explore this data set through multiple lenses - by Education Districts, Blocks and Clusters as well as by MP and MLA aggregations and by PIN Codes.

For every aggregation, except PIN Codes, you will also find demographic, finance and infrastructure reports linked to at the bottom of the right panel.
This is a Beta release and we do need feedback to improve. For future versions, we'd like to be able to analyse data at every level of aggregation over time as well and provide easy ways to export data from selected views.
Please do play with our beta release!

We'd love to hear from you! 

Best,

Team KLP

Thanks, Anand. This is a good point and something we will work on for
the next revision. I don't know if you got a chance to look at the
reports linked to as well? This does do this kind of comparison -
especially on the infrastructure report.

> Looks like the numbers in the circle is an image. It'll be useful to make it text with some CSS style so that it is possible to copy.

Yes. We also want to provide the data in tabular format so that people
can copy it.

Thanks so much for your feedback!

But maybe a search option of what schools in this area don't have toilets. 
The upcoming release with the tabular data will be really useful.  Especially from the toilet infrastructure point of view.  As the sanitation scheme data gives the same breakdown it allows for a great amount of comparison at the district and sub district levels.

But you can do that right now! Zooming in will show you districts,
blocks, clusters and finally schools! Also, if you search of an
MP/MLA/PIN Code it will show you all the schools part of that
aggregation.

So we don't have GPS coordinates for *all* schools but we do have them
for most. They are an assortment of self-collected, volunteer
reported, third-party reported, geocoded and sourced GPS coordinates.
DISE does have them for some but not all states but they do not expose
them, sadly. There are mistakes in the PIN Codes - we used the GPS
coordinates and ran them through PIN Code polygons.

I drafted a letter to be sent to NIC regarding the possibility of a data portal to host public contributed datasets, that is datasets originating from both governmental and non-governmental sources, but contributed only by non-governmental agencies and individuals.
Please see the draft text here: <http://piratepad.net/riWWDkaAAI>.
Please take a quick look and share your comments/modifications. It will be great if we can send this off at the soonest.

Thanks for sharing this. The text is perfectly fine with me. Just
wanted to ask you/everyone else if do we have a list of existing
public datasets that we can recommend for public contribution to this
portal? If it is there, can you please guide me to it, and if it is
not, shall we try and work on the same?

Cheers

I have written a draft with the DataMeet Trust language for people to see.  I have put it as background you can read the letter below.  Shekar will share his version just mentioning Open Data Camp and citizens.  Let's take some time to deliberate this and then we can come up with language and hopefully send the letter and summary to them soon.

Election Commission of India, Nirvachan Sadan,Ashoka Road, New Delhi 110001 25 March 2014Dear Sir:I am contacting you on behalf of DataMeet, a registered public trust in Bangalore which aims to promote a culture of open and public data sharing. Our online community of more than seven hundred members has been active on a weekly basis since 2011. The goal of the group is to promote opening up public data and promote its access and use. Since 2012 we have held meetings in Bangalore, New Delhi and Hyderabad and an annual Open Data Camp (ODC) with more than 150 participants from the education, business, technology and non-profit sectors in India. We have worked with the NIC's Data.Gov.In data portal to promote open formats and ask for various datasets through their request module. Mrs Alka Misra has attended several Open Data Camps and presented their work and interacted with our community around what data we think is important for the government to share. 
In the third annual Open DataCamp on 22-23 March 2014, we dedicated to exploring election data and how citizens can use it to understand the electoral process and create tools that help people gain access to essential voting information.  We had former Chief Election Commissioner Shri T.N. Krishnamurthy deliver the keynote address and discuss his time with the Election Commission.  
During this event we made a list of data that if the Election Commission released in a more open format would provide more transparency and access to this essential information.

Is it for the entire country, or for just a state? How many Unique Postal codes are there? What kind of visualization do you want to do?The main issue we have is that there really isn't a good source for the location of pincodes. However there are a couple of things that you could try.
1) data.gov.in has the pin code data, which includes district, tehesil & Post office name. I feel that this could be Geocoded with Google's Geocoder to get an approximate location for the Post Office. This geocoding could be done online, in Fusion Tables, or offline, via an Excel Macro which I saw being demonstrated in the data camp on this weekend S Ananad.
2)Depending on the size of the data, after joining your data to the pin code data, we will have the district and the tehesil. I have seen some mapping of this to Parliamentary constituency names(https://groups.google.com/d/msg/datameet/yrL-oaiG3Gc/dmEkueijpNYJ). Hopefully PC boundaries should be available quite soon, and with all of this you could make your visualization.

To add to what Vinayak wrote, KLP collects and analyses data from
public schools and pre-schools - about the schools and children and
performance etc. We source data from multiple partner organisations.

We used to use a tool to do something like this and the now deprecated

Hi Venkat,In my experience, schools are very open in anything to do with technology, if clear value and confidence on execution is demonstrated.Two types of schools, 
One, schools who have not tried managing the data digitally. They are very open, interested, curious and they listen.Two, schools who have already tried some kind of digital data management, whether inbuilt system with excel sheets or legacy erp solutions, they understand the value but are very skeptical on the execution part, since they have already burnt their fingers. But if shown confidence on execution, they too are very open.
Happy to share experience!Regards,Balaganesh9043200068

I’m really happy to share that we had a very successful Bangalore
Open Data Camp this last weekend! Thank you to all who came and participated,
the volunteers and the speakers.  You all
really made the event a success. 
 
Also a big thanks to Google for the space, Akshara
Foundation for the travel funds, Oorvani Foundation for supporting the data
journalism track and the hackathon with vision and ideas, and Centre for
Internet and Society for supporting our pre event workshops.
 
We had around 150 people total for Saturday and Sunday about
30 people in and out for the hackathon. I think the overall discussion level
this event was much better and we actually had great projects during the
hackathon. 
 
You can see them here:
http://odc.datameet.org/odcblr2014:hackathon
 
I will be following up with the teams so look forward to an
email this week with some of the results of the hackathon!
 
Video will be done by Saturday we will have it up!  And also speak PPTs will go up soon.
 
Next Steps- 
We are writing a summary of the event – summarizing the
speakers presentations and also if anyone took notes please share so we can
include them in the summary. 
 
We are sending the summary and a letter to the Election
Commission requesting them to make post delimitation boundaries available. Shekar
Krishnan is spearheading this letter and will share the draft with the group
soon. 
 
We can also write letters to Data.Gov.In and ask them to
create a place on their portal for a citizen contribution site for government data
that is cleaned up by citizens. Let me know if anyone thinks this is worth it
and wants to help draft it, reply to this thread. 
 
We can also write a letter to the BBMP with suggestions and
thoughts about making their data more open. 
If anyone wants to help draft that reply to this thread. 
 
We did a great brainstorming session on Data Meet.  I’ll be writing a separate note soon but also
we will be creating a page on Datameet.org for people to put ideas and get
other people to support them.  
 
Thanks everyone for the great event!Nisha and Thej

I'm interested in BBMP data.We need to tell them to make the records of Council meetings and Standing Committee meetings publicly available. This basically will have key decisions that take place that actually govern the city's infrastructure projects (SWD remodelling, underpass, flyover, garbage, roads, town planning data.)
We also have to tell them to make the data bi-lingual (Kannada and English - now it is only Kannada, and not copyable - not in unicode, and not on public domain too). Given the level of awareness that is being created in Bangalore, I think this is worth doing.
I did try writing to commissioner asking them to use the emailing facility to circulate minutes of meetings or upload them publicly - but there was just an acknowledgement of the mail, nothing more.
There is a lot to do with BBMP regarding data. Is any other  municipality doing this? I'm interested to know.

I think it's very useful to know how the data was compiled (sources,
methodology, etc) so there can be some independent verification of its
accuracy. It would also be instructional for others trying to do
similar things. :)

I can also help with that! Guess the best way is to import them into

Beyond the role of electoral rolls in elections – A threat to privacy
and security
Under Registration of Electors
Rules, 1960, electoral rolls can be considered to be open government data
whereas the law directs the Registration Officers to publish electoral rolls
for the purpose of public inspection and to ensure transparency and
accountability of the electoral process. It is an important part of electoral
process. It allows for revision of electoral rolls and it is also an effective
counter measure for bogus voting. It essentially guarantees a free and fair
election. However, the data also provides for opportunities where it can be
abused by people in power.
Ideally, the application of open
government data can be broadly categorized in four main purposes: (i) Accountability
and transparency; (ii) easier access to public information; (iii) evidence
based policy advocacy and (iv) consumer/citizen services. Publication of electoral
rolls does cater to the purposes (i), (ii) and (iv) but the same data can be
used for other purposes which may have an adverse impact on right to privacy of
an individual. The question which really needs to be answered is whether the
purpose for which such open data can be used should be regulated.   Furthermore, is there a higher security risk
with respect to digitization, standardization and centralization of government data
containing personal information of individuals, such as the electoral rolls?
In this context, I would like to
discuss:
> Privacy and Security
concerns regarding digitization, centralization and standardization of electoral
rolls
> Can and should offline
publication of electoral rolls be decoupled from online publication?
> Kind of checks and balances
necessary to address such security concerns
> Whether the current legal
framework is adequate to address such privacy and security concerns?
For more details: See, Snehashish
Ghosh, Electoral Databases – Privacy and Security Concerns available at
http://goo.gl/Exxq0AApologies for the delay.
Thank you.Cheers,

The part that will be used for BPL identification is online http://secc.gov.in/welcome. If you or anyone knows of a way to access the data please let me know.
I believe the NSS data is representative at the state level so maybe district level comparison won't be possible (but I could be wrong). The NSSO data can be purchased from MOSPI http://mospi.nic.in/Mospi_New/upload/nsso/ratelist_UnitData.pdf.
If you are interested in this topic, you might want to look at research by Lakshmi Iyer, Tarun Khanna, and Ashutosh Varshney. They used data from the economic census (which is also conducted by MOSPI). I did a short blog post a while ago at http://theopendata.com/site/2012/02/caste-and-entrepreneurship-in-india/. The paper has now been published and is available at http://www.epw.in/special-articles/caste-and-entrepreneurship-india.html

We do not have equipment to do it , may be Hasgeek can lend ther's but i am in Hyderabad would not be able to comment on it , seen there setup it needs trained volunteers to man it .
so if they share and we get some volunteers for the same we will try to do it , but no guarantees as of now. Try to hang out on irc channel #datameet on freenode and follow the tweeter feeds you will get some idea as to what is happening on the ground .

Quick update about hackathon. It's on Sunday 23rd March.
We have three tracks - Election, Census and Data journalism.

We have started putting together details about each of the tracks,
datasets and some ideas here -
http://odc.datameet.org/odcblr2014:hackathon. It would be fantastic if
you can add to the ideas list and spread the word (just click the edit
button and type away!).

If you know of supporting datasets or something that would be useful,
please expand those sections too. Please ask if you have any
questions.

Bring your own army of data wranglers or team up with people who are
going to be at the hackathon. I'm sure the datasets we have are
interesting and we can start building useful things.

And don't forget to sign-up! http://odc.datameet.org/odcblr2014

See you over the weekend!

Cheers,
Sajjad.

Hi All,

          last week we met at the HILA (hila.in) office and talked about what Datameet is and what we are planning to do for ODC 2014  this year , Anant spoke at length about what is happening with Open data and his particular interests in Politics of it , the week before that Hyderabad had rains and hailstorms and there were some low lying areas which were flooded , Hyderabad municipal corporation did have any data with respect to where the water gets flooded in scenarios like these , he also talked about http://projecthundi.wordpress.com/page/2/ , he said as a long term goal Hyderabad  Urban Labs can anchor Open data initiatives in Hyderabad ,  after that we looked at the present data on election and scraped few . There were some interesting projects HUL is doing particularly the Munn maps http://203.124.106.1/~amphi/gunj/ overlay over Google maps , I personally found it interesting to look up where my grandparents lived and how it has changed over the years , also i noticed the receding waterlines of lakes , there were around 10 people present both tech and non tech who are interested in participating in these kind of initiatives , Anant will be putting these ideas into some form so that Tech people can help seeing the light of the data , here is the http://piratepad.net/98i1A5bpWI we shared while at the event . Also i took some pictures https://plus.google.com/photos/118131677760195552668/albums/5991493509468005937 , we called it a day with Hyderabadi Biryani . I personally want to thank HUL for coming forward and helping organizing this meeting . In coming days after the ODC 2014 we plan to call for a meetup again .

*International Conference on Data Â Sharing and Integration for Global
Sustainability *

*New Delhi, 2-5 November 2014 *

*First Call for Abstracts and Sessions (Deadline: 30 April 2014) *

There are many pressing sustainability challenges facing today's society,
from food and water security

to poverty alleviation and climate change. Such challenges cannot be solved
without multidisciplinary

and transdisciplinary research, as well as the collection, sharing,
integration, use, and stewardship of

data across scientific disciplines and domains, and from international
sources. The effectiveness and

credibility not only of research but also proposed solutions will be highly
dependent on the availability

of well-documented, quality-assessed, and timely scientific datasets. To
facilitate the work of

international research undertakings (including the 'Future Earth' research
programme on global

sustainability to be launched by ICSU and its partners in 2014) and to
amplify the message of like-
minded global data initiatives promoting data sharing and interoperability
(including the Group on

Earth Observations and the recently established Research Data Alliance),
SciDataCon 2014 will

highlight the theme of Data Sharing and Integration for Global
Sustainability.

*The SciDataCon 2014 Steering Committee* now invites proposals for
sessions, and abstracts for

oral presentations and posters, addressing the overarching conference theme
of 'Data Sharing

and Integration for Global Sustainability' and related themes such as those
indicated below.

1. Data sharing, integration, and interoperability to address research
challenges in global

sustainability:

2. Big Data science and technology:

3. Development and sustainability of data services:

* Data publication and citation

* Innovative approaches to data integration and interoperability

* Semantic data integration

* Interoperability standards and reference data

* Software architecture and systems

* Disciplinary and interdisciplinary case studies: environment, health,
social sciences,

humanities, biodiversity, climate change, materials, energy, disasters,
etc.

* Data-intensive scientific discovery

* Large-scale computing software and systems

* Presentation, analytics, learning, and knowledge discovery

* Data mining and visualisation

* High-impact applications

* Data systems and infrastructure sustainability

* Data curation and stewardship, and development of trusted repositories

* Solutions and tools for research data management and data security

* Rescue of scientific data at risk

* Capacity building and education in data science

* Private sector roles and public-private partnerships

4. Scientific data for decision making and policy:

5. International collaboration on research data:

* Assessment of the impact and economic and societal value of data

* Data quality, documentation, and credibility

* Data-driven models and data products for decision- and policy-makers

* Citizen science and crowdsourcing

* Sustainability indicators and metrics

* Open government

* Development of new observational and data networks

* Interoperability and integration of existing data networks

* Data policy and access, particularly in developing countries

Hi Devdatta,

      We have a MySQL database out of which we exported to csv, then
      through VBA to transform to xml.
      We are using Gephi for plotting the points. The map option in
      Gephi is giving us a wierd offset and we don't have (or see) all
      the options to do stuff like the below.

      Thanks,
      Rajesh

This morning I stumbled http://terraformer.io an open source projectby ESRI. Which provides some of those functionalities in Javascript. I hope they continue to develop it.
In the poc you can find your ward by clicking on the map or by searching or by GPS. I will probably add some more features. I was quite excited to show you all specially because we have a GIS related hackathon this weekend.

I extracted it couple of weeks back from voter list pdfs. Looks like that has not changed since then.For example, look at this PDF.
http://ceokarnataka.kar.nic.in/Finalroll2014/English/WOIMG/AC175/AC1750278.pdfIt says that this polling booth belongs to:
191 - Singasandra ward175-Bommanahalli AC26 - Bangalore South  PCwhere as your list says that Singasandra ward belongs to bangalore south AC.
Either a ward is part of multiple assembly constituencies or there is some error in generating those PDFs. Could you please provide the URL when you found these mappings?

this sounds fascinating, and though I cannot be in India at the time, I
wanted to let the GIS group know that I am almost done with AC and PC
shapefiles for the whole country, which will be published under an open
license soon (so as to avoid double and triple work).

These are based on polling station localities published by the EC, and
transformed into constituency polygons using a rather complex
classification algorithm (and cross-checks against GDAL district
boundaries). More to be announced soon - perhaps even before the ODC,

Best,

-- Each lighting talk is for 8 minutes maximum
-- 7 slides = 5 content, 1 title, 1 about me slides-- Presentations have to be sent early so we don't have to waste time on that day. send it by friday. There are only limited slots.
Day 2:- Some of you are already in talks with me/Nisha about the hackathon. Lets continue that and close it by friday. So we can allot time and room
- If you have ideas for workshop and hackathon  (with specific goal and not generic). Then please send it. We can talk and finalize itShort Workshop - 45 Mins

What are you going to use to build the API? We would be interested if
Python/Django could be used. We might also be able to share in the
hosting, and would probably do that in the AWS-Singapore region.

None that I know off of the top of my head, though we will look
before starting to roll our own. There are applications that can
help with bits and pieces of this task, but not an overall solution.

Yes, I agree that this would be very useful. Maybe it can also
convince government, and other institutions, in India to have
proper licences for the data that they release.

We have extensively used GIS with GeoDjango. While GIS is doable,
maybe we should agree upon what the primary purpose of the site should
be. What I thought that you were proposing was a site that acts as a
central location where data from multiple Indian data sources are accumulated,
and provided to users via an API.

While we are also interested in GIS, visualisation, and reporting, to my mind
that should be a secondary focus for this site.

OK, that makes sense. GIS queries are expensive though, and we
will have to worry about how best to handle these.

If you can check out CKAN, I will start articulating our ideas on
how to crowd-source data-import from poorly-structured CSV/Excel
files which unfortunately seems to be the preferred format for many
data sites.

GeoDjango queries translate to postgis if one is using a postgresql
back-end, so I do not think that there is much overhead there. GeoDjango
also does a lot more, including providing an abstraction layer for GIS, so
that I would prefer using it to coding directly in postgis. The alternatives
that I was thinking of were along the lines of spatial search with Solr/Lucene.
These should be faster in principle, but we have not yet benchmarked
them against postgis/GeoDjango.

I would again argue that the first thing to do would be to have a stable system
that provides an API layer over raw data pulled from various sources. GIS,
and such queries would be meta-queries over such raw data, and should be
done later, IMHO.

I wouldn't worry about performance before it's a concern - I think
PostGIS is fairly performant. If one does land up hosting a lot of
data, I'd highly recommend ElasticSearch for its geo support and
scalability, but there's probably a few options. I'd also highly
recommend django-haystack [0] - in most cases, this should let one
fairly easily build out your django project, and add a performant
search indexer when one needs it. I'll be glad to help. Any-how, my
two bits would be ""don't premature optimize"" - I think building
something out using GeoDjango should be fairly clean and
straightforward, and I think django-haystack provides a clean
migration path forward if one does need to scale / use a specialized
indexing tool like Lucene.

Also, for Django APIs, I've been looking at django-rest-framework [1]
recently, and am quite liking it. It seemed a bit of overhead as
compared to just writing vanilla view functions for end-points, but
gives a really nice, auto-documented API frame-work with a nice
in-browser testing page, multiple formats, etc. I had to do some
tweaking to get it to output GeoJSON - any-how, if you are going down
this path and want a hand / second set of eyes, let me know.

About other sort of aggregation / meta-queries, I agree, but I think
basic GIS data can be quite fundamental to this sort of data. Its nice
to be able to query location data, and for data-sets that have
location data, I think would be nice to support? Thankfully, adding
basic geo support using GeoDjango is fairly straightfoward - I agree
that performance maybe an issue, but I think if the site is getting
that many users / has that much data, one could work out more complex
solutions then?

Anyways, let the bike-shedding not get to you, Thej :) - do whatever's
easiest / makes sense - do let me know if I can help / contribute /
when there's code up, etc.

All the best!
-Sanjay

We have a mobile-based data collection platform, Fieldata
( http://www.fieldata.org ) that can be used for this, free of
cost at the basic tier which should suffice here. One builds
a form for the data collection, using our GUI form builder,
which contains all details necessary. The data can include
GPS locations, photos, etc. The form is downloaded to an
application on an Android phone, based on OpenDataKit,
and anyone with access can submit data. We would also be
glad to help in building the form.

To get a quick picture of the facilities available on Fieldata,
log in to a demo account from the top right of the home page:
User/password = gora+fossdotin@mimirtech.com/foss.in123
On the dashboard that you arrive at, choose the ""Demo
questionnaire"", and you can have various views of the data
from under the ""Reports & Data"" drop-down towards the top.
Data can be exported as CSV.

Regards,
Gora

Subject: {blrtreeproject} Tree Documentation-Bannerughatta road
To: bangaloret...@googlegroups.com



Hi All,WCG(Wildlife Conservation Group) is organizing Tree documentation work on coming weekend. Please find the further details below
Agenda:Documenting the trees of Bannerughatta road from Bannerughatta to Anekal
Programme description:Avenue trees have provided unconditional shade and shelter not only to fauna and avi-fauna but even human beings from time immemorial. We have depended on these old pillars of our Nature who've existed for centuries. Today we might not need them because we have air-conditioned environments inside cities, but they continue to give so much to the living world around.
This is a unique invitation to members of our Natural society to voluntarily contribute in understanding of the population and species of these beautiful avenue trees in our neighborhood, in an area under-looked by passing traffic and pollution; the trees need to be documented to make ourselves realize that we indeed love and value them, and their presence will not be forgotten.
How do we document:GPS point with species name and detail photographsbirds and insect diversityplanning to do short film on Trees.Who can participate:StudentsPhotographersTree Lovers
Environment enthusiasts & conservationistsTaxonomy experts Birders Why we are documenting:Its good to know our trees – they are our lifelineDocumentation will help to spread the love and value of trees to younger generation.
Documentation will certainly help to preserve the existing treesWho we are:Wildlife Conservation Group [WCG]A small group of people interested in environmental conservation.When:8th and 9th of March 2014 . Documentation begins from Bannerugatta Circle .
Time :8AM to 12 PMMaterial you can bring:Hat and water bottle	Meter tape 10-mtBooks on avenue treesBird bookBinocular CameraRegistration is freeContacts:Subbu Badal : +91 9742786628

I did a small POC recently to see if its achievable.  I think its quite possible even-though a little difficult.  I posted the results on my blog a few minutes back.  http://thejeshgn.com/2014/03/06/bangalore-tree-survey-poc-results/  I am pasting the content here for easy access. Please do reply, specially regarding the questions


Bangalore Tree Survey – POC Results
by Thejesh GN
Bangalore, once upon a time called Garden city, still has quite a bit of green cover. Almost every week we read a story about cutting down trees for some reason. But nobody knows the details, including the people who write those articles. I thought it would be great if you had a baseline survey of trees, which can be used for comparing, or many other stories and studies. But imagine mapping every public tree (tress in public areas like road, parks etc) in Bangalore. It will probably take years if I start doing it alone. But then there wa no way to find out other than trying it out.
So I asked DataMeet as usual. I figured that a PoC by me would be a great place to begin. Hence I installed ODK on my phone and ODK aggregator on server to collect the survey data. That was easier than I thought. Then this monday I walked around for 15 minutes to survey the trees, in an area which has lots of trees. I mapped around 18 tress in 15 minutes by walking half a kilometer. Some screen shots from the apps




Some issues that I faced
1. GPS logging is not very accurate. It has 4 to 8 meters of error, how do we fix it?2. Roughly every tree takes 2 minutes, take a picture of tree, take a picture of leaves/fruits/flowers, geo tag. How long will it take for whole Bangalore. It has to be done by foot right?
3. Quality of pictures, depends on the time of day, camera quality, how big the tree is and patience
Some ideas, learning and questions1. ODC is easy to use, works really well, even offline2. Crowd source: Can we crowd source this project? We can have mapping parties. People just need mobile (no internet) and time. Once they finish the survey, they can either come to the camp or go home to sync the data
3. We can use maps (gis) to assign the roads, areas to groups. Check the progress and coverage. This will help in organizing4. Can we finish this in years time? What about delta after that?5. What else can we do?
6. What kind of data do we collect live? For example Tree name can be figure later.

I am working on PDF electoral rolls, but struggle with unicode
conversion issues (a Crystal Reports bug in the version the ECI
currently uses, at least in some states such as UP or Gujarat, which
leads to a corrupted ToUnicodeCMap, which means you cannot properly copy
and paste from the PDF, or otherwise extract proper UTF8). If your 'free

shall send any progress from my side...

Just a word of caution - this is against Google Maps / Search Terms of Service. Even if you scrape the data out we cannot use it in any meaningful way.

We briefly spoke about starting to gather election related data to a single GitHub repository some months back. S. Anand and Satyakam Goswami have already started the work at: <https://github.com/datameet/india-election-data>.
How about we do a meet-up (for 2-3 hours?) and contribute various election related datasets (that we know of) to the GitHub repository? 
As other emails in this list have pointed out, many such datasets are either difficult to download (e.g., HTML tables) and/or difficult to use (e.g., PDFs). Some of us in the meet-up can work on scraping HTML tables, and some can download the PDFs and rename and organise them so that they can be easily accessed when we do the PDF Liberation hackathon in March.
For those uninitiated to GitHub, we can also have a parallel 'Git(Hub) Basics' session.

How does that sound?As for venue, I can think of Akvo, Change.org, and AirWoot offices. First two are near Green Park Metro St, and the last is near Saket Metro St.

Our only interest is to use the Survey as a means to raise the level of public debate, from Individuals to Issues.All data in the past has been available for the asking.

Urbanization can be look at both from stock (where are people) and flows (what is the dynamics). In addition to asking their current area of residence, you maywant to ask their home town in order to detect whether the individual
is a migrant and we can potentially map movements. Alternatively you can ask for the duration of residence in the given location. Another thought is to ask about gender attitudes. Are incidents

* The survey of 2.5 lakh would certainly be exhaustive but I personally feel it could be over-done.  Sampling can be somewhat lesser than that to yield more focussed results (for easier post-survey processing, I suppose). 
* But that said, the survey could seek to not to fully replicate efforts such as what the CSDS' Lokniti already does. One weakness I believe that the Lokniti surveys have is that while the questionnaires gauge background and attitude towards politics variables quite well, they don't necessarily capture reasons and expectations that much well. 
So, for e.g.,if the questionnaire and data can be more than just ""what are the reasons you vote for a candidate"" .. maybe, ""why do you think your choice of party/candidate is better than the alternative"".. ""what schemes have you benefitted from during MP's tenure / or hope to benefit from"".. Also, opinions such as ""who do you think could be an ideal leader?"" to reflect opinions on the kind of representatives they would like to have ... is another thing that would be helpful. 
* Beyond political opinion, better knowledge of class backgrounds will also be useful (in terms of profession, homes, access to facilities etc).

Daksh is currently conducting a Nationwide in-field survey about people's perceptions about their MPs. We're talking to nearly 2.5 lakh (that's 250,000!) people in nearly 10,000 locations, in over 500 MP constituencies. The math works out to about 500 responses in each Constituency - stratified and randomized enough to give an analyst a fairly clear picture of what people are thinking. The data consists of 10 demographic details (gender, rural/urban resident, religion, occupation, qualification, roof-type, assets owned, etc.), four ""political awareness"" points (""Did you vote..?"", ""What are the reasons you vote for a candidate?"" and so on) and upto 30 issue-based Performance questions (bijli / sadak / paani kinds of things). Respondents tell us how important they think a specific issue is (Low / Medium / High) AND how well they think their MP has done in that specific issue. We've done thins kind of thing for Karnataka MLAs before and one of the more populist results was a series of MLA Scorecards that appeared pre-election in Vijay Karnataka, Indian Express and Times of India in 2013. With this much-wider survey, though, we're wondering about the various other things we could do - from mapping people's perceptions about caste and criminality to inferring rural and urban unemployment rates. But that's probably the low-hanging fruit. How else could this data be used? Ideas welcome!

But in our past surveys, we've found 6% to 7% of the responses being ""outliers"" that we've had to discard. And this time being a national effort, we wanted to overdo things, if need be, since re-doing a constituency is not really an option.
The survey does attempt to get some sense of the respondent's socio-economic background - age, education, rural/urban, roof-type, basic assets, stove-type, etc. And we've debated various ways of asking questions, trade-offs between questions that are easily understood and that are comprehensively stated, the impact of translation into Hindi and other languages, etc. We've also stayed away from ""incidental"" assessments of things like leadership qualities; instead, we've added a direct option about whether the PM Candidate is an issue the respondent uses in deciding whom to vote for.
I want to point out that the intent of this survey is NOT to be a barometer of how India will vote but to identify issues that people can verbalize (and MPs can use) in relation to their constituencies. The impact of having over 2.5 lakh people discussing these issues with their friends and family will be significant, we believe, in people making an informed choice in voting.
I'll post a link to the questionnaire later today.

Here are some answers.1. Physical because our intent is to get the opinion of aam janta. And less than 10% of them have Internet connections. The biases in only-online surveys is unbelievable.
2. Non-OCR for Hindi was an operational decision that some of our surveying teams took - something we (and they!) are regretting now. We'll stick to OMR everywhere in future, with an offline app for the surveyor in a large number of cases.
3. We have multiple vendors, some volunteer-based and some commercial. Karnataka was actually easy, thanks to our years of works here - we use a network of Govt teachers. Happy to introduce you/others to any/all of our vendors, if you're interested.
4. The survey process started in mid-Dec, to create lists of 15-or-so stratified-randomized locations In each MP constituency. Field work, driven off of a short guideline document and training, started in early Jan 2014 and will complete by the first week of March.
5. By ""validation"", if you mean the data that is being received, we have a number of check-points we go through, to ensure that surveyors are actually doing what they're expected to do. We begin with the random locations that people are supposed to visit and ask for a travel plan at the lowest level of detail; we have volunteers calling random surveyors daily, checking their location via questions, call-backs, etc.; we have field visits by non-interested parties to validate that surveyors ARE where they say they will be and are doing what they say they are doing; surveyors also submit images and video from the locations they visit; I can go on. The data itself is being analyzed for  surveyor-bias, outliers and other typical problems, as it is received.

I like the way you stated the problem: ""impact of having over 2.5 lakh people discussing these issues with their friends and family will be significant, we believe, in people making an informed choice in voting"". What I was wondering was if these conversations that people are having in their constituency maps with the larger political discourse that MPs are having in LS. Stated the other way, the issues that citizens verbalize - are they getting proper representation in the actual political discourse in the floor of the house and to what extent. 
I am guessing, that a comparison of what people say is important to them (from the Daksh survey) vis-a-vis what MPs are discussing on the floor(data available on the ADR/myneta website) could be helpful. 
I apologize if its vague but I personally be very interested to see if its the people's opinion that inform political discussions, or are there other forces at play.

We did attempt this exercise in Karnataka: to map the issues from our surveys with the issues discussed (or even raised as questions) by MLAs. Unfortunately, we were unable to find a reasonable basis for the mapping, since questions are listed under the ministries that respond, while our issues are not field-level. And a large number of the questions (available in print form only, thank you) are so wide-ranging or unclear that they can't reasonably be pigeon-holed into the issues that we listed in our surveys. We have higher hopes on such an exercise with the Parliament, though, since issues are all available online and are better classified. That's something we're looking to do after the election drama is over.

You could do the same sort of thing, but seeing how to present the information in a way that motivates voters: e.g. if you tell someone who is SC that 60% of SCs in their area vote based on the candidate rather than the candidate's caste, how does that cause them to respond? Or if you told the same thing to someone who is general caste, how does that cause them to vote? In general, it would be interesting to understand better how voting choices are based on their perceptions of other people."

all, Just came across this group, and excited to read about all the cool data
tasks that people are working on. I’m currently trying to link a dataset of
school data (DISE) to the MP/MLA constituencies (and eventually maybe
panchayats) in which they are located. Each school has its district, block, village
and PIN code listed. I was really hoping to connect it to assembly constituencies
using the PIN code data, and avoid doing any name-matching. My plan was to use
the GPS coordinates of PIN codes and then link them using the GIS maps of
constituencies. However, I haven’t been able to find a large enough dataset on the GPS coordinates of the pincodes. Does anyone know of a good public
(or private) source of this or have another suggestion for how to do this? I
have the dataset that someone in the group made using Open Street Maps, and it’s
great, but it doesn’t cover a lot of the pin codes (especially the rural ones).
Or are there companies that are willing to sell it for a reasonable price?Thanks!"

If for Karnataka, we can help as we did this exercise to create reports like these: http://www.klp.org.in/reports//infrastructure/English/MP_Bangalore_Central.pdf
If for the entire country, you can buy polygons of PIN Codes from http://www.mlinfomap.com/ as well as MP constituency polygons.

«Open Access and scientific research: 
towards new values»


Tunis, 27-28 November 2014

Presentation
While the Open Access
(OA) movement, with its green and gold routes, has reached a certain maturity
in the world and mainly in developed countries thanks to the policies of
strengthening open access to Scientific and Technical Information (STI) in all
areas, it continues to progress in the developing countries including  the Arab and African  states.
Indeed, the advance of
OA in these countries was prejudiced by the lack of awareness among researchers
and policy makers of the benefits it could provide in terms of visibility of
scientific production, democratization of access to research results and
application of performance indicators in the academic environment.
This conference is a
contribution in order to propel the OA movement globally and especially in the
countries of the South endorsing reflection on issues related to the role of OA
in the valorizing of scientific research. It tries to show the different
approaches and policies related to this new model as well as the feedback and
the role that libraries have to play in this new scene. The objective of the
conference is to promote the exchange of experiences, views, and research
results between researchers, academics, and librarians from different
disciplines, on related aspects to the new models of scholarly communication.
It will be a good occasion to discuss how to offer solutions to common
challenges.
It will provide an
overview on the latest innovations in the field of OA to STI and raise
awareness of researchers and different stakeholders of the benefits of OA and
get them actively involved in this movement. Moreover, there will be an
opportunity to build networks of collaborative work between researchers from
different countries that could initiate joint projects.
Themes 
Academic researchers
can submit papers in one of the following themes:
-         
Open Access Theories:
the theoretical foundations of the OA movement and the reasons for its success

the emergence of new business models related to OA and the development of
digital output and digitisation;
-         
Open Access Policies
:  the establishment of institutional,
national or international policies for access to STI;
-         
Implementing Open Access at universities: achievement and evaluation of OA resources
such as open archives (disciplinary and institutional repositories), Open
Access Journals (OAJ), scholarly social networks…);
-         
Open Access and utilization of scientific research: State of the art and emerging new practices
for researchers;  
-         
Open Access to STI and Libraries: role of the libraries and the librarians in the establishment, management

Hello all,Between February 11th and 15th, HasGeek presents three events: a single-day workshop + conference on AngularJS for front-end and JavaScript developers; two days of workshops on web and product design and CSS frameworks conducted by renowned designers; and two days of talks on front-end development and design at Meta Refresh.
These events will benefit UI engineers and designers by giving them opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and meeting some of the best upcoming talent from the field.Regards,Zainab Bawa,for HasGeek.

Each year, HasGeek organizes Meta Refresh – an annual conference on how to create excellent user interfaces on the web. Meta Refresh brings together UI/UX designers and front-end developers. The workshops and conference at the 2014 edition have been curated to help designers and developers learn the finer details from each other – attention to detail, performance optimization, usability and aesthetics. The workshops and conference feature prominent and upcoming speakers from the fields of product design, typography, responsive web design and front-end engineering – Bram Pitoyo (Mozilla, New Zealand), Chris Lüscher (Information Architects, Switzerland), Sunit Singh (Design Lead at Cleartrip), Arpan Chinta (Uncommon) and Souvik Dasgupta (Miranj). These instructors and speakers will train and share some of the best emerging practices in the field of UI design and engineering with participants.
There will be two days of skill training workshops on 12th and 13th February (open to 60 participants) and two days of conference on 14th and 15th February (open to 500 participnts). Avail discounts on purchase of four or more corporate tickets.
We have also introduced a new series of single-day mini conferences from this year. The first Minconf is on AngularJS, an emerging JavaScript framework for web applications. There will be tutorials and talks on various aspects of AngularJS. This will help young and mid-career JS developers to understand AngularJS and how it can be used to build apps at their companies. AngularJS Miniconf takes place on 11th February.
Finally, we are introducing a new feature at HasGeek conferences – an at-venue kiosk for Hasjob showing only jobs related to the topic of the conference. If you are interested in publicising openings for designers and front-end engineers at Meta Refresh (14-15 Feb), contact Radha Rao (ra...@hasgeek.com) for more details.

      Hello Folks,
I am looking for (historical) data of various income groups across the
country. What I am looking for something similar to:
0 - 10,000 - % of total population
10,001 - 50,000 - % of total population
 
I thought the IT dept. would have such data, but could not locate it.
Tried data.gov.in, ministry of statistics, world bank & etc.
 
What I was able to locate was SEC, but it is primarily education vs
occupation. 
 
Any help / leads would help.

Aditya

Thank you folks. I had seen some links earlier and saw a few new ones
sent by you. 

I happened to read somewhere (I lost the link!!!) that income tax
department has stopped sharing the numbers and somebody I think has
filed a RTI or a PIL.

Anyways, the data I was looking for has been elusive! Maybe I need to
rethink and see if I could use some other data for the analysis I have
in mind.

Thank you again.

Cheers

2368,Nisha,#topic/datameet/M_Ne0DCHu5w,1,2014-01-29 03:56:00,[Bangalore] ODC 14: Election Edition,"Last week we had a Hangout to go over the plan for the ODC
14.
 
I want to say we have gotten a confirmation that we can use
Google’s Offices this year. 
We need to confirm the dates. 
March 15th 16th or 22nd or 23rd.
Do you all think we will have enough time to get the camp
done by the 15th 16th? 
 
We need to raise money for travel funds, tshirts, stickers,
and some other needs?
About 2 lakhs should cover the total cost for the camp.
 
Should we charge for the camp? 
Last year we were able to cover the costs for food and some
essentials by charging. We can also do the same this year. However I feel we
shouldn’t charge anything more than 500 rupees.
 
2 days
 
1st Day Talks around theme:
The Theme this camp is Elections:
The tracks proposed are the following
Election Data Access and Uses
Election Data: improving data, privacy concerns, 
Accountability Data: What information do we need regarding
MPs and MLAs and how we get it, how we use it?
Data and Election Coverage: How do journalists use data to
cover elections?
 
I will do a follow up email doing deep dives for the tracks,
who we should invite and how to structure them.
 
2nd Day Free Space, Hackathon?, Workshops?
If we do a hackathon it needs to be very structured with
real outputs that have anchors. 
Citizen Matters is interested advising
Some potential projects:
Crowd sourcing creation of shapefiles
Boundary matching – from districts to MP boundaries –
problem solving
 
Also I would like day 1 to generate ideas and projects for
Day 2.  So that there is non curated time
so people can come together and brainstorm and come up with projects for Day 2
and beyond. 
 
Build up to ODC
Several Events can be done and have been suggested
-         
Free the PDF hackathon – a lot of election data
is in PDFs
-         
GEOBLR meeting on shapefile issues
 
The full notes from the meeting are below. Some additional
questions:
How many people want hardcore workshop?
How many workshops? What subjects?
Specific people/institution and orgs that we
need to Invite?
Specific ideas, subjects that we need to
handle?
Volunteers for printing, reaching out, final
day, PR, media etc?
Volunteers for the website contribution?
 
IF you want to Volunteer for ODC14 let me know I will be
putting everyone who is interested on the Volunteer group so we don’t spam the list
with the logistics.Let me know what I missed!Nisha

This is also available with the census website. 3) Then simply merge the 2011 districts into their parent district to get a 1991 shapefile. The only issue will be when a district was created by bifurcating more than one district. In this case, you may want to do some digging using google maps and see which parts came from which original district and then use snap tool in Qgis to  just make your own tentative boundary. 4)Centroid can be gotten using the centroid option in QGIS as well. I had to do this in order to get a 1969 shapefile for Indian Districts. Hope this helps "

            & Leadership For Results: Social & Environmental
            Well-Being in a Thriving World
 13-15
            February 2014
Dear Colleague
 On behalf
          of TISS and WWF we are delighted to invite you to an unique
          event and workshop on leadership for systems change titled “Design
            and leadership for results: social and environmental
            well-being in a thriving world” at WWF Auditorium, WWF,
          172 B, Lodhi Estate, New Delhi from 13 to 15 February 2014
  To build
          a world based on the values of equality and justice, we need
          new leadership capacities; to think differently, plan
          strategically and act on principles with accountability. These
          new capacities must be able to completely align principles,
          purpose and practice to build a better world.
  This
          workshop will provide you with tools to expand your reach and
          impact to lead your work and projects to make a difference in
          the world. It offers the opportunity for established or
          budding leaders from the media, government, civil society,
          public and private sector to explore issues that can transform
          your work, organisations and initiatives to focusing on social
          and environmental well-being for results with systemic change.
  We are
          extremely fortunate to have Dr. Monica Sharma, Tata Chair
          Visiting Professor, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS),
          a world-class facilitator and former Director, Leadership and
          Capacity Development, United Nations, to conduct this
          workshop. Her capacity to foster leadership and design large
          scale projects to source commitment and deliver tangible
          results is globally recognised.
 All sessions are interactive, engaging
            participants actively. The consultation will not provide
            prescriptive solutions – rather, it will challenge each of
            us to delve deep into our being; and generate new,
            breakthrough ideas, sourcing our abilities to envision a new
            future, commit ourselves to action and acquire the skills to
            attain this future.
 A background note with further details of the
          workshop with the purpose and objectives of the workshop and a
          profile of Dr. Monica Sharma is enclosed. Please also find
          attached a short application form to be filled with this mail
  This
          workshop is being run on a not-for-profit basis, and the funds
          raised by the participant fees are to compensate for the
          organising costs of this programme. The workshop costs cover
          workshop material, Lunch and Tea/Coffee during the three days
          of the workshop.
Please also note that the
          programme fees should not be a barrier for attending the
          workshop.

2429,srinivas kodali,#topic/datameet/Qp9OpZMnIsk,1,2013-12-23 04:25:00,Open Access to Transit Data in India,"Hi everyone,
This post is regarding policy requirements for open access of transit data in India.

The Indian Government is spending significant amount of money in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) around the country through Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM). Most city road transport corporations are already implementing such systems by tracking city buses with GPS units. Mysore and Delhi are good implementations for these systems apart from pilot implementations across all major cities.

But open access of data for public and developers is limited. The contractors for these implementations are fooling the transit organizations by coming up with clauses withholding raw data with them.

The planning commission working group for 12th five year plan on transport has recommended an investment of Rs. 8520 crores for ITS and  a total of Rs 3,88,308 crores in transport sector by the government ( document attached ).

There is a huge requirement for policies and data standards in transit space to save public money and to solve traffic problems.
I am not sure how i can contribute in terms of policies to get open access and need some advice in this regard. I have been working on city real-time traffic information as a developer for couple of years.  

Regards,Srinivas

2430,Suvajit,#topic/datameet/Qp9OpZMnIsk,2,2014-01-01 18:15:00,Re: Open Access to Transit Data in India,"Hi Srinivas,  You are right. ITS has been the buzzword in the country in Public Transport sector for couple of years after the 12th Planning commission suggestions for inclusion of technology to fillip the usage and betterment of PT across country.   But, the adoption on ITS is quite low across country due to the fact that there are no vendors to implement it the right way. Mysore KSRTC is the only full ITS implementation in the country. It is still far in terms of usability and usefulness. Visit mitra.ksrtc.in to see how you can track buses in realtime. But access to data openly in terms of API or any other form does not exists.Lack of confidence and confusion is prevailing more. Across all level in the domain everyone is looking for a successful model which can be referred to.So, in this situation,access to open data in terms of routes, schedules, bus stops, GPS logs is a bit too much to ask for. Firstly the data acquisition has to be in place. No one is talking about data standardization for now.You have rightly pointed, that push for open access to the ITS data is needed through policies and followed by tender contracts. An initiative can be taken now for ITS data standardization and access mode definition. Regards,Suvajit"
2431,srinivas kodali,#topic/datameet/Qp9OpZMnIsk,3,2014-01-09 08:40:00,Re: [datameet] Re: Open Access to Transit Data in India,"Hi Suvajit,I apologize for the delayed response. I wouldn`t call mysore implementation full yet, there are lot of challenges still in the industry and the acceptability among commuters. But following data standards and open-access to data will help the community and researches solve these challenges effectively.  
GPS logs were being collected in Bangalore buses in offline mode since 2008, it was a big failure. No one knows what happened to the data. It`s high time all the transport agencies follow data standards in India. Until these standards are followed, it`s mere wastage of public money on experiments with no results. 
Currently the transport agencies don`t have the rights on transport data, the only reason being the contracting firm holds the rights over data (over public data!!!!).  Atleast this is the current scenario with BEST in Mumbai and MTC in chennai.

A organization running out funds and grants from corporates? (I haven't check the sources of fund of Embarq India) so I may be out of line here. Does privatizing all essential services provide a solution? BMTC a private limited already runs volvo and a/c services only for the rich and elite. Look at the number of a/c services to these places and no of trips to these elite sections of the city. All new buses are run to elite sections of the city and older, run down buses are moved to lesser localities. How does one question this as a citizen? By publicly available data I assume. Talking to AAP about public service and need to open up data and its advantages may get us this data and question this inequality. I still don't consider them as a political party like others in India. May be thats for another conversation. Having said that any change one asks outside of oneself then is asking for change in others and thats in a realm of politics (my view on asking for change) Im interested in exploring opening up of transport data with along with you. Arvind Vegan designed Mobile device"

I understand the inequality of services being provided by different transport agencies, but most of these agencies are deprived of funds. I will not take any names of agencies in this regard, but i will agree to the fact that availability of data both operational and financial will help researchers solve these issues. 
I am looking for different individuals or officials who are  already working in this area and their expertise for technical standards.  I will loop you in when something kicks off.

for ready made maps - maybe somebody from the TV channels / media who have already done it and used in the election results discussions yesterday (Times NOW had some interesting visualizations) can help.
else, it is hard wok for now. :)If somebody can work on the impact of NOTA (none of the above option) on the losers (in terms of margin of loss versus NOTA), it can show some interesting patterns. This is crucial since Chhattisgarh saw a 3% NOTA and the difference between congress and bjp vote share was less than NOTA and New Delhi 1%. this is interesting behavioural science to track.

NOTA could have had significant effect in Delhi and chhattisgarh when the vote share between 2 parties are very close and a decimal point shift could lead to significant shifts in results. the logic stated in delhi, people who could have gone to vote for NOTA (during elections) have chosen AAP on the rebound. would there be a way to prove this otherwise
it could give a perspective ""what if""? did somebody not put the right amount of effort in convincing the NOTA group to vote? the reason for interest in NOTA  is that 33% of delhites did not vote also. would there be some lessons to be learnt from this.

I have done quite a bit of work on this. One problem is, there are two
datasets - one cleaned up, one preliminary:

http://www.eci-polldaymonitoring.nic.in/psl/default.aspx
http://www.eci-polldaymonitoring.nic.in/psleci/default.aspx

For the preliminary data for UP, have a look at my website here:
http://data.raphael-susewind.de/content/gis-shapefiles

For all-India data, I have the preliminary raw point data, but can't
make up my mind whether I should clean it up and make it available now,
or hope that the EC themselves will clean it up further in the current
run-up to the general elections, in which case I could save myself the
trouble and just wait a few months longer.

Also, I am wary of the polling booth ID codes at the moment; for UP, for
instance, they changed slightly with the current roll revision - booth
IDs from 2011-13 are not necessarily the same as those in 2014.
Currently, my website operates with 2011-13 IDs, and I intend to wait a
little longer until I upgrade to 2014 IDs...

And nope, there are no other places where this data is available to my
knowledge (unless you know somebody deep inside the NIC or EC),

A critical inquiry into the ever-present media metanarrative and the esotericism of conversations in a brave, new and inordinately connected world. A comparative assessment of the dynamics which may affect Indian journalism, post-Tehelka. A unique take on the inherent subjectivity in all of that.Â 
This is cyber-anthropology 101, pointing towards the effect of the hacker counterculture of the 80's in shaping the radical ethos of social media.
It also ruminates on the shapeshifting within the global media industry, like the acquisitions of WashPo, NSFW; the Omidyar-Greenwald venture; Guardian's convergence journalism in the NSA story and NYT's Snowfall, etc.

What do you mean by ""web logs of the browser"". A user's browser
does not normally keep logs.

Do you mean logs from a site's webserver? If so, you can get these
only for sites that you control, in a location dependent on the site
configuration. It would be a huge security hole if anyone could get
webserver logs for any site.

Cache and History could be analogous to logs.

This is still not making sense to me. There is no such thing as a ""site's
web browser"", so I presume that you mean the web server. I do not then
understand what is ""my web history logs in the google for the day"". As
mentioned earlier, webserver logs for external sites are not normally made
accessible to the browser, or to Google.

If it is your own site, you can add some kind of analytics for users visiting
the site: Probably the easiest way to start is with Google Analytics. Also,
awstats is an open-source logfile analyser that can deal with Apache logs.

You and I apparently have a very different understanding of what
constitutes a log file. Especially in this context, where the OP seems
to want some kind of user analytics.
Oh no. I agree with you. However, I misunderstood the OP's question (he clarified somewhat later). I really thought he wanted to see his web browser's 'logs'. i.e. the sites he had visited. In the absence of said logs, I just suggested where he could look. Note that I said ""analogous to logs"", not implying that they are logs.
Santosh Kumar:What you are looking for is session management for logged in users and anonymous visitors. This can be accomplished quite easily but the implementations differ with the language and framework you are using on the server side. You should ask this question on a web programming forum, I think it is quite off topic here.

That problem is common to whatever crawler you use. Nutch will extract links from JavaScript, but that's it. I would use Rhino, and a custom HtmlParser plugin for Nutch. This is admittedly non-trivial, but I know of no open source tool that already does this.

Would be great to get ideas on: 1) additional sources of data sets and 2) types of projects you might want to make with it.  Also, would love to have people from DataMeet come by and participate and lend their data expertise to the groups!  Send any thoughts you have.

 [datameet.delhi] notes from datameet-up, held on 22 nov

sumandro <suma...@gmail.com> Nov 26 10:12PM -0800
        
      Dear all,
 
Sorry for the slight delay in sharing my notes from the DataMeet-Up last 
Friday.
 
Please find the notes here: 
<http://datameet.org/2013/11/27/notes-datameet-up-delhi-22-nov/>.
 
Feel free to add to and correct the details in the note by commenting on 
the post.
 
I have created a dedicated repository at DataMeet GitHub org page for the 
election data mapping work. Access it here: 
<https://github.com/datameet/india-election-data>.
 
Go take a look at the format for documenting found (relevant) datasets 
here: 
<https://github.com/datameet/india-election-data/blob/master/data-doc-format.md>. 
Use the same format to document the datasets, and then push the actual data 
file into the repository as well. Please remember to name the data file and 
the documentation file in a similar way. Mark required data 
cleaning/reorganisation/clarification tasks by opening an issue (where the 
name of the data file is mentioned).
 
Alternatively, access the Google spreadsheet here 
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Arxi0bhhq-OxdE1tT2pNemZOWlRremRTZUp5ZUVfX2c&usp=sharing> 


and add the details of the documented dataset.
 
Feel free to share suggestions and ask for clarifications.
 
Bests,

Hyderabad, We are hosting a small event in Bangalore this
Wednesday(tomorrow) at 7 High Street. The event, DataLore will focus on
misrepresentation of data in maps and visualizations.

Please join us if you are in/around Bangalore!

Date/Time: Wednesday, 20th November at 6 PM,
Venue: 7 High Street, Cooke Town, Bangalore. (Map: http://is.gd/LTOqW7)

More information about the event (http://do-din.org/datalore/):

People who want to make the world a better place look towards data in an
effort to make that change. This very data then needs to be channeled
into maps, statistics, and visualizations before it can be useful — and
people are doing this everywhere. Stories of politics, corruption,
oppression, and war are being told around the world using such tools.
Unfortunately, a lot of what is being made fails at its task.  Maps that
miss the point, visualizations that fail to engage, and statistics that
mislead, all undermine action. On Wednesday evening, as a run-up to
Do-Din, DataLore will attack this problem on two fronts:

""You can’t just throw a map at a problem"" - Sajjad Anwar

When all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.
There are maps being made for every reason but some of them lack the
point, they misrepresent information, they lie or they fail to engage
the audience. We would like to discuss how people come up with these
maps, what disasters they cause and how, as storytellers, we can improve
the situation.

""Nothing is what it seems — especially not statistics"" - The Ballot

As they say, there’s lies, damned lies, and then there’s statistics.
It’s easy to mislead or be misled by statistics and visualizations.
Preconceptions and agendas can leak into them, and colour them with
bias. Sometimes, a lack of knowledge about statistics leads to false
conclusions, which is rather disastrous. We’ll use some examples to show
you how this can happen, and how to both interpret and represent data
properly.

About the speakers:

Sajjad Anwar is a hacktivist and programmer based in Bangalore. He works
in the research and design of data analytics and infographics. He hearts
maps and often makes one. Along with two others, he runs the
geohackers.in collective. Find him on Twitter.

The Ballot is an initiative by Pooja Saxena and Nirbheek Chauhan which
releases weekly visualizations depicting statistics about India’s
democracy. You can find their work at http://theballot.in.

Date: 12 November 2013 14:20Subject: [LODLAM] Open Repositories 2014 -- Call for ProposalsTo: lod...@googlegroups.com
*
* apologies for cross-posting  **
The Ninth International Conference on Open Repositories, OR2014, will be held 9-13 June 2014 in Helsinki, Finland. The organizers are pleased to invite you to contribute to the program. This year's conference theme is:
            Towards Repository Ecosystems
Repository systems are but one part of the ecosystem in 21st century research, and it is increasingly clear that no single repository will serve as the sole resource for its community. How can repositories best be positioned to offer complementary services in a network that includes research data management systems, institutional and discipline repositories, publishers, and the open Web? When should service providers build to fill identified niches, and where should they connect with related services?  How might these networks offer services to support organizations that lack the resources to build their own, or researchers seeking to optimize their domain workflows?  
Examining how repositories best integrate into the holistic research flow; exploring ties between domain-specific repositories and institutional repositories; and understanding durable content strategies outside of traditional repository environments are the central themes of the Open Repositories 2014 conference. We welcome proposals on these themes, but also on the theoretical, practical, organizational or administrative topics related to digital repositories. We're particularly interested in hearing about:
* Unconventional approaches to repository-like services
* Interconnection between publishers and repositories* Researcher-centered design for scholarly workflows
* Adaptations to support curation lifecycle management, e.g., for research data* Real-world scalability and performance stories: working at web-scale, with big data for global usage
* Requirements for holding restricted or classified data in repositories* Infrastructure to accommodate national and international mandates for data management and open access
* Positioning repositories closer to (local, consortial, or cloud-based) cyberinfrastructure for data processing
* Leveraging connections to external services including:            * Remote identifier services (e.g., DOI, ORCID)
            * (Re-)using repository data/metadata in new and unexpected ways, including integrated discovery
            * Scholarly social media services, such as for annotation, review, comment, reputation, citation, and altmetrics
            * CRIS and research management systems            * Digital preservation tools, services & infrastructure
* Community and sustainability in an open world
KEY DATES
            • 3 February 2014: Deadline for submissions            • 4 April 2014: Submitters notified of acceptance to general conference
            • 17 April 2014: Submitters notified of acceptance to interest groups            • 9-13 June 2014: OR2014 conference
SUBMISSION PROCESS
Conference Papers and PanelsWe welcome proposals that are at least two pages and no more than four pages in length for presentations or panels that deal with digital repositories and repository services. Abstracts of accepted papers will be made available through the conference’s web site, and later they and associated materials will be made available in a repository intended for current and future OR content. In general, sessions are an hour and a half long with three papers per session; panels may take an entire session. Relevant papers unsuccessful in the main track will automatically be considered for inclusion, as appropriate, as an Interest Group presentation.
Interest Group PresentationsOne to two-page proposals for presentations or panels that focus on use of one of the major repository platforms (DSpace, ePrints, and Fedora) are invited from developers, researchers, repository managers, administrators and practitioners describing novel experiences or developments in the construction and use of repositories involving issues specific to these technical platforms.
24x7 Presentation ProposalsWe welcome one- to two-page proposals for 7 minute presentations comprising no more than 24 slides. Similar to Pecha Kuchas or Lightning Talks, these 24x7 presentations will be grouped into blocks based on conference themes, with each block followed by a moderated discussion / question and answer session involving the audience and whole block of presenters. This format will provide conference goers with a fast-paced survey of like work across many institutions, and presenters the chance to disseminate their work in more depth and context than a traditional poster.
""Repository Rants"" 24x7 Block. 


One block of 24x7's at OR14 will revolve around ""repository rants"": brief exposés that challenge the conventional wisdom or practice, and highlight what the repository community is  doing that is misguided, or perhaps just missing altogether. The top proposals will be incorporated into a track meant to provoke unconventional approaches to repository services.
Posters, Demos and Developer  ""How-To's""We invite developers, researchers, repository managers, administrators and practitioners to submit one-page proposals for posters, demonstrations, technical how-tos and technology briefings. Posters provide an opportunity to present work that isn’t appropriate for a paper; you’ll have the chance to do a 60-second pitch for your poster or demo during a plenary session at the conference. Developer ""How-To's"" will provide a forum for running a mini-tutorial or demonstration in the developer lounge, if there are enough interested parties.
Developer ChallengeEach year a significant proportion of the delegates at Open Repositories are software developers who work on repository software or related services, and once again OR2014 will feature a Developer Challenge. An announcement will be made in the future with more details on the Challenge. Developers are also encouraged to make submissions to the other tracks--including posters, demonstrations, and 24x7 presentations--to present on recently completed work and works-in-progress.
Workshops and TutorialsOne- to two-page proposals for Workshops and Tutorials addressing theoretical or practical issues around digital repositories are welcomed. Please address the following in your proposal:
            • The subject of the event and what knowledge you intend to convey            • Length of session (e.g., 1-hour, 2-hour? half a day? whole day?)            • How many attendees you plan to accommodate


            • Technology and facility requirements            • Any other supplies or support required            • A brief statement on the learning outcomes from the session            • Anything else you believe is pertinent to carrying out the session
Submit your paper, poster, demo or workshop proposal through the conference system. PDF format is preferred. Please include presentation title, authors’ names and affiliations in the submission. The conference system will be open for submissions by 16 December 2013, and is linked from the conference web site: http://or2014.helsinki.fi/

WORKSHOP
DETAILS:""Visualizing open data to bring out global
issues""Thanks to the large amounts of open data being
released for free on the Internet, we can take a quick glimpse at
current issues characterizing our world. Although, this complex data
is sometimes difficult to be understood in its initial form.By
going from theory to practice, we will show where data can be quickly
gathered from, and by using open source technologies, put it in a
visual context to make relevant issues easy to understand. In
addition, attendees will be encouraged to discuss topics involving
each of us.The goal of this workshop is also to increase
awareness of the importance and benefits of making information
available for everybody and how sharing knowledge is one of the steps
towards making our planet better.
Table
of contents:1. Introduction to Open Knowledge and Open
Data1.1 What are open knowledge and open data? Why do they
matter?1.2 Examples of administrations and organisations
releasing information to the public domain.1.3 Transparency in
politics as a way to achieve real democracy.2. There is so
much data out there, and its free!2.1 Online sources where
you can get open data.2.2 World Bank as major data hub.3.
Why visualization matters3.1 Understanding complex problems
by looking at simple graphs.3.2 Examples of data visualizations
we have developed describing worldwide issues in the fields of
Politics, Environment, Education and Social development.4.
Practical session4.1 How to build a data visualization in 5
minutes using free online tools.4.2. Technical questions related
to the tools used.5. Open debate5.1 Which data would
I like to visualize? Attendees have the opportunity to propose topics
and relevant data they would consider interesting to explore.
Everyone will be also encouraged to publish their own data
visualizations on our platform.Target groups:-
individuals or collectives.- interested in open source
technologies and the philosophy behind open knowledge.- searching
for data sources for research.- working with visualizations.-
developing a conscious approach to global topics.- having general
interest in the topic.

General updates from the network.2. Presentation of data visualisation work. Please suggest possible presenters. Maybe Avinash Celestine of <http://datastories.in/>?.3. Breakthrough.tv is planning out a host of activities, one of them being a hackathon, during the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence period from November 25 
(International day for the elimination of Violence against Women) to 
December 10 (Human Rights day). Shobha SV, Manager, Multimedia, Breakthrough, earlier wrote to us that they ""want to organise a hackathon on the issue of violence against women (VAW). 
It'll be great to use various datasets available pertaining to the 
issues of VAW and create different visualisations to represent it. We 
are keen on working with the active open data community in Delhi."" We look forward to have Shobha in the meeting and discuss out how DataMeet can collaborate with Breakthrough in this hackathon.4. We were planning earlier to organise a hackathon around the upcoming Delhi election. That could not happen. But let's work towards a hackathon addressing the Lok Sabha election coming up next year. I have already spoken to Dr. Sanjay Kumar of Lokniti <http://www.lokniti.org/people_lokniti_sanjaykumar.php> regarding this and he expressed his interest in mentoring the analysis of election data process. We should also reach out to Nirbheek Chauhan and Pooja Saxena of <http://theballot.in/>. We will have an initial discussion towards this election data hackathon.Please feel free to suggest additional agenda items for the meeting. And let us know which date during November 18-22 will be suitable for you.

2540,Maya Indira Ganesh,#topic/datameet/BTrc4qVBIhA,1,2013-10-31 02:28:00,Tactical Tech film screening & book launch on Nov 7,"This year Tactical Tech completed two projects about how activists
    and political actors make things seen -a book called Visualising Information for
      Advocacy, and a film series called Exposing the Invisible.
    We're thrilled to finally be able to share these with you, so please
    join us for a screening of the films and book launch on Thursday,
    November 7, from 6-8.30pm at No. 7 High Street in Cooke Town. We
    will be showing two episodes of Exposing the Invisible with a sneak
    preview of the third, and talking about the book. Copies of the book
    will be available for sale (drinks and snacks are on the house).Â  

    RSVP: bang...@tacticaltech.org
    Directions: http://osm.org/go/yy4fWbaep-?way=39158767

    About the films: Exposing the Invisible is Tactical Tech's new
    series of short films profiling inspiring and provocative artists,
    hackers and activists working with a range of digital investigative
    tools to expose what has been hidden from us. The films follow the
    unraveling of corporate networks in Azerbaijan, how video channels
    like Youtube are used to expose arms smuggling into Syria, the theft
    of Lebanon's seashore, balloons that record demolitions in East
    Jerusalem and the unseen war waged by drones in Pakistan. Learn more
    about the project here: https://exposingtheinvisible.org

    About the book: A good campaign is like a good joke. A joke's
    effectiveness relies on the use of the right words, good timing,
    convincing delivery and a strong punch-line delivered to the right
    person. When visualising information for advocacy these are the
    factors we need to consider. In our new book, Visualising
    Information for Advocacy, we explore how to influence issues using
    the right combination of information, design, technologies and
    networks. Through more than 60 case studies of visual information
    campaigns from around the world,we show how to capture attention,
    present stories and take our audiences on visual journeys through
    data. See more about the book, click through some sample chapters or

SMS data collection actually is more useful in a lot of places than an Android App.  
Whether we like it or not spreadsheets are how most data is collected.  We can tout new technology all we like but it's still a ways to go.  Also a lot of data that is has been collected is sitting in excel sheets or word docs or paper formats that have been collected in the past.  This post has come from many experiences my team had with NGOs trying to clean up past data.  
The upcoming posts will look at new projects that require data collection and how we can help make it more streamline.  I will add these tools to a list of resources though for further reference!

Smartphones are now about 4k, much cheaper than a computer that can run Open Office / MS Office. Most survey apps take into account intermittent coverage and cache results locally till they can be uploaded, and so on.
Historical data can sit on a spreadsheet for now, but new data can and should go into a properly normalized database, and then exported to whatever format is convenient. And then there's also the wonderful side effect of not having to version spreadsheets, as anyone with 2013_new_project_methodology_x_survey_results_final-new-updated-2.ods will tell you.

[...]
Agreed. Our experience has been that most organisations are immediately appreciative of the benefits of data collection based on smartphones. As you note, Android smartphones are now cheap, and even with the one-time sunk cost of purchasing the devices, our platform is usually cheaper than paper-based methods, besides being less error-prone. SMS can be used if there is a big sensitivity to price.
Spreadsheets are also unstructured, and difficult to convert to API-based access, which is needed for any generic analysis methods not customised to a specific data format embodied in the spreadsheet. IMHO, this is the biggest problem with the current data sets on data.gov.in

Gora

Sample here (http://chemmunish.com/answer%20key%20+2%20Full%20Physical.JPG). 
It require one time investment on a good OCR machine (really not very expensive and  less error-prone).  If the machine is a constraint,  little programming with a fast scanner will do the job. 
However, the success with OCR based survey really depends on the designing of the survey.RegardsSailendra

teachers themselves and have no real control over them, giving them
smartphones would be risky for us because we'd probably lose many of
them. Also, with paper, the replacement cost and time is easy and it
is a known work flow for most government institutions - stamps, seals,
signatures and what not. Lastly, we currently have a error rate of
paper to digital transcription under 0.5% because our data entry work
flow uses a double entry system. Also, at the scale we operate at,
phone devices are expensive and it's much easier to scale paper and

The spreadsheet comes in when the data management part comes in. In most cases, electronic input devices can't straightaway replace this because of a number of factors
1. Data collectors may not be used to using computers/tablets etc.. Smart phone use with active internet usage is quite low.2. Giving each data collector a device may not be possible given the costs involved.
3. NGOs typically don't have capacity to manage data, leave alone web based apps, tablets etc. Even if they all have android smartphones, someone needs to design a good database. This capacity is also quite rare.
4. Design of questionnaires is also often not done very well, so that you can't predict that the responses will always be from a predefined list etc.The fundamental issue is the capacity to handle data from design to analysis and presentation. The android tech part is one piece of the puzzle. I see the fieldata type of initiatives helping solve part of the problem. Data literacy is a more urgently needed input.
I do agree that android devices and associated tech such as opendatakit have helped bring down the cost to a potential adopter. However, most NGOs are unlikely to have any budget allocation towards data collection devices, unless they do a lot of surveys.
As Nisha has mentioned, this is a first post in a series. We will be covering other aspects such as technology adoption as well. If any of you has any already documented cases on using opendatakit or any other such app we could benefit from your sharing the experience.

WORKSHOP
DETAILS:""Visualizing open data to bring out global
issues""Thanks to the large amounts of open data being
released for free on the Internet, we can take a quick glimpse at
current issues characterizing our world. Although, this complex data
is sometimes difficult to be understood in its initial form.By
going from theory to practice, we will show where data can be quickly
gathered from, and by using open source technologies, put it in a
visual context to make relevant issues easy to understand. In
addition, attendees will be encouraged to discuss topics involving
each of us.The goal of this workshop is also to increase
awareness of the importance and benefits of making information
available for everybody and how sharing knowledge is one of the steps
towards making our planet better.

2568,sumandro,#topic/datameet/dFfyom1cTtQ,1,2013-10-06 04:57:00,[datameet.delhi] plan for next datameet-up in delhi,"Dear all,Apologies for this much delayed update.


We last met in end of August at MimirTech office in Green Park.There were several first-time members in the meeting. Sudarshan and Muthu from TISS presented their coastal mapping work, and Gora from MimirTech presented their integrate platform for collecting, archiving, and analysing data, called Fieldata <http://fieldata.org/>.
We were supposed to do some agenda setting for the next steps and programmes of the Delhi chapter of DataMeet. We did not advance much on that front.
From the discussion, two specific interests of the group came out clearly: (1) let's go ahead and do some data visualisation, and (2) where can we get data from?
The main difficulty in starting data visualisation works, for the group, is lack of availability of data. <data.gov.in> portal surely has a lot of data but we were note sure how much of that is actually usable, or has sufficiently details for analysis. It is still the most obvious place for us to start looking for.
It was suggested that we should also speak with non-governmental organisations who have primary data that they might be interested in sharing. If any of these organisations are interested, maybe the DataMeet network will be interested in collaborating on a hackathon -- the organisation brings data, DataMeet brings hackers and researchers.
Further, recently there has been a plan floating around to quickly organise a hackathon (hackday?), in early November, with datasets related to the upcoming Delhi election. I have spoken to Dr. Sanjay Kumar of Lokniti <http://www.lokniti.org/index.htm>, who has recently published a book titled 'Changing Electoral Politics in Delhi' <http://www.lokniti.org/changing_electoral_politics_in_delhi_from_caste_to_class.html> about the Delhi Election hackathon idea, and he expressed interest in supporting the effort through Lokniti's datasets and also by mentoring the data analysis processes. He will join us in our next meeting to understand our interests and to plan out the hackathon.
Which brings us to the question of the next meeting. Since we were talking about <data.gov.in> portal and its shortcomings in the last meeting, I have requested the NDSAP Project Management Unit (in NIC) to let us organise the next meeting in NIC. Tentative dates are 17th (Thursday) and 18th (Friday) October. Will be held at 5:30 pm. If the NIC plan does not work out, we may hold it either in Akvo office (Green Park) or in Sarai (Civil Lines).
Will let you know when I hear from NIC.

I am out of town till the 28th, but please go ahead with a date that
suits everyone. Another possibility for a venue is http://moonlighting.in/

fellows,
after
two sucessfull events in Mumbai and Baroda, Open Steps is now
pleased to invite you to its workshop in NCR (National Capital
Region) on the 23rd October (4-6pm).
Open-Steps
is an initiative from two young berliners Alex (spanish, software
developer) and Margo (french, european politics) who decided to leave
their daily lives and travel around the world for one year. On this
journey, they are meeting people and organisations working actively
in open knowledge related projects, documenting them on their
website. Also, open data is the area where their both backgrounds
converge and that's why they run a workshop entitled
âVisualising
Open Data to bring out global issuesâ
on
the way and research about the current situation of open data in the
countries they are visiting.
This
event is organised with the support of fossevents.in
and Kayako
Support Systems Pvt Ltd
and will take place in their office, Building
14, Tower B, 16th Floor, Cyber City, Sector 24 (Near Ericsson
Building), Gurgaon, Haryana, India.
For
more information, visit www.open-steps.org/workshop.
We
hope to see you among the audience on 23rd October and are looking
forward to discussing with you about open cultures & open data in
India!

WORKSHOP
DETAILS:""Visualizing open data to bring out global
issues""Thanks to the large amounts of open data being
released for free on the Internet, we can take a quick glimpse at
current issues characterizing our world. Although, this complex data
is sometimes difficult to be understood in its initial form.By
going from theory to practice, we will show where data can be quickly
gathered from, and by using open source technologies, put it in a
visual context to make relevant issues easy to understand. In
addition, attendees will be encouraged to discuss topics involving
each of us.The goal of this workshop is also to increase
awareness of the importance and benefits of making information
available for everybody and how sharing knowledge is one of the steps
towards making our planet better.
Table
of contents:1. Introduction to Open Knowledge and Open
Data1.1 What are open knowledge and open data? Why do they
matter?1.2 Examples of administrations and organisations
releasing information to the public domain.1.3 Transparency in
politics as a way to achieve real democracy.2. There is so
much data out there, and its free!2.1 Online sources where
you can get open data.2.2 World Bank as major data hub.3.
Why visualization matters3.1 Understanding complex problems
by looking at simple graphs.3.2 Examples of data visualizations
we have developed describing worldwide issues in the fields of
Politics, Environment, Education and Social development.4.
Practical session4.1 How to build a data visualization in 5
minutes using free online tools.4.2. Technical questions related
to the tools used.5. Open debate5.1 Which data would
I like to visualize? Attendees have the opportunity to propose topics
and relevant data they would consider interesting to explore.
Everyone will be also encouraged to publish their own data
visualizations on our platform.Target groups:-
individuals or collectives.- interested in open source
technologies and the philosophy behind open knowledge.- searching
for data sources for research.- working with visualizations.-
developing a conscious approach to global topics.- having general
interest in the topic."

The GTFS API reference from Google is really comprehensive and answers
all your questions -
https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference
If you have questions related to the feeds, organizing them and making
it open, you should ask them on the Transit Developers mailing list -
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/transit-developers

The data is not too recent, but that's what Google is using for the
transit directions for now.

HTH.

Most of this info is held by closed sites like tendertiger.com etc. I think this is an un-necessary barrier.

Also govt is supposed to keep aside some budget for awarding tenders to small businesses but I can't find any such info.

Also did not find any info while googling about projects that have tried to scrape tenders.

 is about something that has been simmering in our minds ever since 
Siddharth Hande and I attended the opendatacamp in Bangalore earlier 
this year. I have also been discussing this with some of you offline. We
 have finally mustered the confidence that we can pull together an 
interesting event in Hyderabad that builds on some of what we learnt at 
the ODC at Bangalore. 
The website for the event is at  Do Din
http://www.do-din.org 
facebook community is at Do Din Facebook Community
The
 idea is to organize a two-day event called Do Din over the weekend of 
December 14 and 15 of this year. We are thinking of this as an annually 
recurring event. This being the first year, is our first attempt to put 
in place and test the principles of organizing an urban event of this kind. We
 want to blur the divides between technology, 
social science and art. So, we are organizing the event in two 
intertwined tracks: 
one being an urban technology track in which we are broadly thematizing 
as urban data: maps, apps and visualization. We want to pack in a series
 of brainstorming sessions and thick 
interactive and collaborative work sessions involving data users (e.g. 
government and non governmental).The other is an urban art track in 
which we are organizing a series of events that will allow people to 
share  stories about living in these cities. 
We see this really as an opportunity to bring together data 
practioners and users of different kinds together around the urban 
question. The event will be organized in 
an area that will be easily accessible to everyone from all over the 
city.We will keep updating you as we go along. But we
 need help in brainstorming and organizing the sessions. So please do 
look up the website and the fb page. And we look forward to suggestions / ideas on this list (or offlist) on how to make this work. anant maringantiOn behalf of Do Din organizing committee

Has anyone seen any regional language NLP work being done at a product level? Bit about my background...I work for Uniphore, a local language speech recognition company based in Chennai. It was incubated out of IITM a while back. And has been doing IVR (Interactive Voice Response) telephony systems for the last 6 years. More recently has got into mobile speech apps.So for example, state governments and a bunch of MNC's, use our platform to collect simple data (type of crop, date of planting etc) from farmers, over the phone using speech recognition. The data then gets analysed and useful info is sent back on planting, weather,pricing etc to increase yields. Its also being used for rural banking, healthcare, education and many of other interesting things.We are seeing pretty good recognition rates in many regional languages for small data sets. So if the system is asking the farmer for the month of planting, the recognizer only needs to look for 12 possible matches (and some variations to account for accents, pronunciation etc) which is relatively straight forward to do these days. We have been trying to move up a rung, away from carefully structured dialogues, to more natural sounding ""free speech"" based interactions, supporting much larger vocabularies. Needless to say, this is a hard problem...to put it mildly :) especially if you are working with regional languages where training data both audio and text is virtually non existent.So just wondering if there are others out there grappling with the same issues and feeling the pain? Would be great to connect and share experiences. Also pointers to people working in this area would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot,Sharun"

National Conference on Opening up by Closing the Circle: Strengthening Open Access in India
UNESCO, in partnership with Central Library, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), and the Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia (CEMCA) is organizing a national conference on ‘Opening up by Closing the Circle: Strengthening Open Access in India’ on 21 October 2013 to mark the international Open Access Week.
The first international Open Access for Research Week was celebrated on 19–23 October 2009. Hundreds of leading academic and research sites in over 30 countries marked the week in unique ways, and expressed their support for the advancement of knowledge through free, immediate, online access to the results of scholarly research.
Ever since, Open Access Week has been observed internationally to help raise awareness of the potential benefits of Open Access (OA) for research, and to celebrate milestones in making OA a norm in the conduct of science and scholarship.
The one-day conference will focus on the need to create an enabling environment for OA in India, to promote and upscale existing OA initiatives, and to encourage the development of new OA programmes. This can be done by ‘closing the circle’ or linking multiple stakeholder groups, namely researchers, librarians, archivists, publishers, technologists, and policymakers, taking into account their concerns and views and providing a platform for them to advocate for a common cause. The conference will provide a unique opportunity to stakeholders to pool their insights, identify and discuss key OA-related issues in the country, and create a roadmap for strengthening OA in India.
The specific objectives of the national conference are to:

Build awareness among the stakeholder groups and student community about the importance of OA to scientific research
Facilitate the exchange of experiences, knowledge and best practices of various institutions in the OA space
Contribute towards the creation of an advocacy group that will promote OA at institutional and national levels
Analyze current trends and pitfalls with regard to the OA landscape in India
Develop policy recommendations for the creation of a national mandate to promote OA
Promote partnerships and collaborations among interested stakeholders

Venue: JNU Convention Centre, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Mehrauli Road, New Delhi 110067
The conference is open to all Library and Information Science professionals. The academicians/researchers interested in open access may also attend. There is no registration fee. Registration is restricted to only 100 participants on “first-cum-first serve basis”. Registration can be sent by email at unes...@gmail.com with following information:

1. The importance of OA in India
Open Access has emerged during the last decade or so as a movement and a business model whose goal is to provide free access and re-use of scientific knowledge in the form of research articles, monographs, data and related materials. Faster and wider sharing of knowledge fuels the advancement of science and, accordingly, the return of health, economic, and social benefits back to the public. By removing the barriers of price and permissions, OA publishing promotes the global flow of knowledge; improves access to ‘developed-country research’; creates much-needed visibility for ‘developing-country research’; and allows researchers and practitioners to access current knowledge.
The idea of open access to scholarly literature is not new to India. India has a large S&T research community and Indian researchers conduct research in a wide variety of areas. India also trains a very large number of scientists and engineers. One might believe that all is well with science and technology in India. But the truth is very different. In terms of the number of papers published in refereed journals, the number of citations per paper, and the number of international awards and recognitions won, India’s record is not all that encouraging.
India has a vast pool of academic talent and a track record of excellence in disciplines related to science and technology, but this is at odds with the limited endowments that academic libraries receive to support scientific research. Most Indian libraries cannot afford to subscribe to key journals required by researchers and scientists. This is a serious impediment to the acquisition of knowledge, and researchers’ own scholarly output is adversely impacted as a result. Another outcome of prohibitive subscription costs is the low visibility of Indian research.Academics in the region exert themselves to publish their work in well-known journals which very few of their peers can access afterwards. This leads to the poor citation of works by Indian researchers, the poor circulation of their research findings, and ultimately very limited awareness about scientific developments in the country. Thus, Indian scientists face two problems, namely, access and visibility. Both these handicaps can be overcome to a considerable extent if open access is adopted widely both within and outside the country.
2. Noteworthy OA initiatives in India
The lack of awareness might still be an issue for Indian researchers, but there have been various initiatives by Indian institutes, journals and publishers to make research content open. Since 2003, India has been contributing to The Directory of Open Access Journals (which contains free, full-text high-quality scientific journals). The Indian Medlars Centre (IMC), has taken the pioneering step of putting Indian biomedical journals accessible on to a single platform. IMC’s first bibliographic database IndMed, established in 1998, provides abstract level information from more than 70 journals. The Indian Academy of Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy are premier institutes that run vibrant publishing programmes and offer open access to their journals and papers. Bioline International is a not-for-profit collaborative effort of the University of Toronto Libraries, Canada, the Reference Center on Environmental Information, Brazil, and Bioline, UK. Bioline provides access to 14 Indian journals on their primary site as well as archives these journals at the Bioline EPrints Archive. ePrints@IISC is a repository that collects, preserves and disseminates in digital format the works of the research community of the prestigious Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. Open J-Gate – a free database of OA journals – currently offers access to more than 4000 OA English language journals from across the world. The work of Medknow Publications, an innovative publisher of OA journals, and that of the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela are also leading Indian contributions to the OA movement. It is important that these initiatives should not operate in isolation, but should form part of a concerted effort and campaign at a national level to promote OA in India.
In 2012–13, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) launched a major OA initiative. ICAR has formulated an OA policy stipulating that its member institutes across the country must allow open access to their research and technical publications, books, catalogues, conference proceedings, case studies, lecture notes and other digital objects. While these institutes will maintain their own OA repositories, ICAR is setting up a central harvester to allow ‘one-stop access’ to all the scientific and agricultural knowledge generated within the Council. Master repositories such as ICAR’s, composed of a network of repositories, greatly enhance accessibility, help realize the potential of OA, and strengthen the very purpose of the OA movement in India. But while developing policies and networks at the institutional level is necessary, it is critical to entrench the idea of OA at the level of national policy. A national mandate and policy framework for OA would ensure that OA initiatives cease to operate in isolated clusters, and become part of a coherent, progressive national movement to promote the flow of knowledge.
3. OA in India vis-à-vis global trends
Open Access is of particular importance to the Global South because it provides an unprecedented opportunity for equitable access to essential research information from around the world. So while removing the price barrier is important, the key to Open Access is that it allows researchers and the institutions they work for to regain control of their intellectual labour and capital by disseminating the research they produce in ways that they see fit, and not simply according to the business logic of for-profit publishing houses. This will hopefully result in a more balanced production and dissemination of knowledge from around the world.
With free software such as the Open Journal System, and with peer-review being performed without cost as a long-standing tradition, the cost of producing journals is far lower than commercial publishers would have us believe. The Directory of Open Access Journals now list over 8,500 titles from around the world; most do not charge an author fee. These Open Access outlets provide important opportunities for knowledge dissemination while reducing costs substantially for the libraries.
Most universities in North America and Europe have set up repositories individually or as consortia, and an increasing number of higher education institutions in the Global South have also set them up to feature their faculty’s research output. In addition, many universities have also set up publishing platforms such as the Open Journal Systems and other kinds of open source platforms to allow faculty to engage in Open Access publishing and other kinds of innovative digital scholarship.
However, many repositories remain poorly filled because researchers are often not aware of Open Access, or they have misconceptions about it and copyright, or about quality issues associated with it, not realizing that Open Access is compatible with traditional peer review and copyright. Hence more awareness-building efforts are needed to educate researchers about the benefits of Open Access, and the limitations and unsustainability of the traditional system.
In addition, a policy should be put in place to encourage researchers to deposit their research articles and materials into the repositories. Many institutions now enact either a voluntary or a mandatory policy requiring their faculty to deposit a copy of their work into the repository. It is also crucial for administrators to be better informed about the detrimental nature of adhering to the narrow use of the journal impact factor as a means of research evaluation.
In 2013, the Obama administration declared that all publicly funded research would be made freely available within 12 months of publication. Research councils in the UK have recently begun to make public-funded research open to all. The European Commission is expected to do the same from January 2014. The applicability of these approaches to the Indian context, and their potential benefits, must be seriously considered by stakeholders in the country.
In India, Open Access is now a key topic of discussions and engagement at many higher education institutions (including universities and deemed universities) as well as high-level research organisations, such as the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Department of Atomic Energy, the Indian Space Research Organisation, the Defence Research and Development Organisation, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research. The tireless advocacy work of Subbiah Arunachalam [Chennai-based information consultant] has been instrumental in sensitising these key institutions in the Open Access debates. However, a strong national or institutional policy on Open Access is yet to be implemented.
At the same time, some key institutions such as the Indian Academy of Sciences have been playing a leadership role in providing Open Access to the journals they publish, and the Indian Institute of Science has one of the longest running institutional repositories with the most content in the country. There are now over 350 Open Access journals being published by various organisations across India, but they cover mostly areas in science and medicine. Social sciences and the humanities are poorly represented. Of the close to 600 higher education institutions across India, fewer than 100 have an existing institutional repository, though many are in the planning stage.
In an editorial piece in Current Science, Prof. P. Balaram, Director of IISc and Member of the National Knowledge Commission observed: ‘The idea of open, institutional archives is one that must be vigorously promoted in India. The introduction of legislation that vests copyright with institutions, in the case of publicly funded research, may also provide the necessary legal framework to avoid any contentious issues. Mandating open access for all publicly funded research publications is easy to do by legislation.’
4. UNESCO and Open Access
UNESCO promotes OA as part of its mandate to build inclusive knowledge societies, whose overarching goal is to facilitate the global flow of knowledge and to strengthen socio-economic development. UNESCO’s OA initiatives focus primarily on improving access to scientific information (journal articles, conference papers, datasets etc). Working through strategic partnerships, UNESCO seeks to build awareness about the benefits of OA among policymakers, researchers and knowledge managers. The organization encourages the development of OA-enabling policies; engages in global OA debates; and cooperates with local, regional and global initiatives in support of OA. As a leading advocate of OA, UNESCO adopted a policy in May 2013 to make its publications available free of charge and with an open license, in order to increase their accessibility and visibility. Major current initiatives include a partnership with the Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia (CEMCA) to develop curricula and self-directed learning tools for OA for librarians and researchers; and the upgrade and enhancement of UNESCO’s Global Open Access Portal (GOAP), a unique online resource that helps policymakers understand the global OA environment, and provides insights into the OA framework of individual UNESCO member states.
5. Scope of the proposed National Conference
UNESCO proposes to partner with CEMCA and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) to organize a day-long national conference on Friday, 25 October 2013 in New Delhi during Open Access Week (the third week of October). The tentative title of the conference is ‘Opening up by Closing the Circle: Strengthening Open Access in India’, and it will be held at JNU. The title connotes the need for concerted efforts to create a more enabling environment for OA in the country, to promote and upscale existing OA initiatives, and to encourage the development and launch of new OA programmes which will lead to establishment of a national OA policy. This can be done by ‘closing the circle’ or


linking multiple stakeholder groups and taking into account their concerns and views – namely researchers, librarians, archivists, publishers, technologists, and policymakers – and providing a platform for them to advocate for a common cause. The conference will provide a unique opportunity to stakeholders to pool their insights, identify and discuss key OA-related issues in the country, and create a roadmap for strengthening OA in India.
6. Structure of the Conference
Beginning with a keynote address by a leading expert on open access to scientific research, the national conference will be structured into two panel discussions and a Round Table (RT) discussion. The two panel discussions will be on the themes ‘Why open access?’ and ‘The open access environment in India’. The RT discussion will be on the theme ‘Towards a National OA Policy: Forging the Missing Links’.
The first panel will explore the benefits and advantages of OA for researchers, academics and scientists, and will assess the relative merits and demerits of the ‘green’ and ‘gold’ approaches to OA publishing. It will draw attention to especially innovative features of leading OA initiatives in India and in other countries, and will discuss the advantages of these alternative, non-commercial publishing models.
The second panel will present a detailed overview of the OA environment in India, with a particular focus on the impediments to the widespread acceptance of OA. Core issues will include the need for a national OA mandate; sound institutional publishing and archiving policies; the lack of awareness, human and technical capacity; and the need for intensive advocacy and skill-building within the LIS community. The potential efficacy of the self-directed learning tools being developed by UNESCO and CEMCA will also be discussed.
The deliberations of the RT will be preceded by a rapporteur’s brief summary of the key issues emerging from the two panel discussions. On the basis of these points, the RT will revisit and update the recommendations made by the National Knowledge Commission in 2007 on the formulation of a national OA mandate. The RT will also develop a template for national OA policy framework The RT’s recommendations will subsequently be compiled in the form of a policy brief that will be circulated among decision-makers and policymakers.
7. Objectives
The objectives of the national conference are to:

Build awareness among the stakeholder groups and student community about the importance of OA to scientific research
Facilitate the exchange of experiences, knowledge and best practices of various institutions in the OA space
Contribute towards the creation of an advocacy group that will promote OA at institutional and national levels
Analyze current trends and pitfalls with regard to the OA landscape in India
Develop policy recommendations for the creation of a national mandate or framework to promote OA
Promote partnerships and collaborations among interested stakeholders

8. Expected Outcomes
As a result of the national conference, it is expected that:

OA stakeholder groups and the participating student community will appreciate the significance of OA, and will have understood the key trends, issues and challenges pertaining to the development of OA in India;
The innovative character and successful operation of leading OA initiatives in India will have been highlighted;
The collective efforts and actions behind the OA movement will be understood, and will inspire the next generation of researchers and librarians to become advocates of OA
Participating stakeholders will engage in a dialogue about possible partnerships and collaborative ventures
A set of recommendations will be developed for the creation of (a) a national OA mandate and policy framework, and (b) a general template for institutional OA policies, repositories and archives.

9. Target Group
The national conference will be attended by university students, librarians, researchers, academics, publishers, and representatives of journal consortia, developers of technological solutions, decision-makers, government representatives and policymakers.

 [New Project] Visualize, Discuss and Rate Open Data

Rushabh Mehta <rme...@gmail.com> Oct 01 04:58PM +0530
        
      Dear all,
 
We just built this small app (in continuation of our earlier efforts) to quickly browse open data. The vision is to create a common repository of open data that is annotated and visualised.
 
The cool feature is that we have built a small graphing engine around this that will help to visualize the data and the settings can also be saved.
 
Site:
http://opendataproject.in/
 
Example:
 
See the boom in foreign tourists since 2003
http://opendataproject.in/#tourism-statistics-of-india-since-1991
 
So see how passenger earnings multiplied 3 times in the decade of 1990 - 2000 (if this data is correct)
http://opendataproject.in/#operations-of-indian-railways
 
Would love to have your feedback on this.
 
best,
Rushabh

This is really great effort.  Visualization engine is cool.
 
 
> Site:

> Would love to have your feedback on this.
 
Is there an automated way to import the data from data.gov.in or you
have to modify it someway to visualize ?
 
All the best for the data.gov.in challenge.

      Neependra,
 
Thanks! I think the app challenge is extended by a month - (maybe not enough entries ?)
 
But none the less - would be happy to take this project forward. I could immediately spot so many interesting stories. Like earning from foreign tourists is up from 1500 cr to 80,000 over the last decade..
 
I am thinking of adding an insights section where users can contribute interesting stories from the datasets.
 
Here is the script to download datasets from data.gov.in
 
https://github.com/webnotes/opendataproject/blob/master/scripts/get_data_from_data_gov_in.py
 
Also plan to hoard many more datasets!
 
best,
Rushabh

Dear Sridhar.Gutam,

A new post has been published by Sridhar.Gutam. 
Read this post on AIMS

ICAR adopts Open Access policy
Today (13th September 2013) the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) had announced its Open Access policy on its website. The full-text of Open Access policy of the ICAR is follows:

	ICAR adopts Open Access Policy


		Each ICAR institute to setup an Open Access Institutional Repository.

		ICAR shall setup a central harvester to harvest the metadata and full-text of all the records from all the OA repositories of the ICAR institutes for one stop access to all the agricultural knowledge generated in ICAR.

		All the meta-data and other information of the institutional repositories are copyrighted with the ICAR. These are licensed for use, re-use and sharing for academic and research purposes. Commercial and other reuse requires written permission.

		All publications viz., research articles, popular articles, monographs, catalogues, conference proceedings, success stories, case studies, annual reports, newsletters, pamphlets, brochures, bulletins, summary of the completed projects, speeches, and other grey literatures available with the institutes to be placed under Open Access.

		The institutes are free to place their unpublished reports in their open access repository. They are encouraged to share their works in public repositories like YouTube and social networking sites like Facebook ®, Google+, etc. along with appropriate disclaimer.

		The authors of the scholarly articles produced from the research conducted at the ICAR institutes have to deposit immediately the final authors version manuscripts of papers accepted for publication (pre-prints and post-prints) in the institute’s Open Access repository.

		Scientists and other research personnel of the ICAR working in all ICAR institutes or elsewhere are encouraged to publish their research work with publishers which allow self- archiving in Open Access Institutional Repositories.

		The authors of the scholarly literature produced from the research funded in whole or part by the ICAR or by other Public Funds at ICAR establishments are required to deposit the final version of the author's peer-reviewed manuscript in the ICAR institute’s Open Access Institutional Repository.

		Scientists are advised to mention the ICAR’s Open Access policy while signing the copyright agreements with the publishers and the embargo, if any, should not be later than 12 months.

		M.Sc. and Ph.D. thesis/dissertations (full contents) and summary of completed research projects to be deposited in the institutes open access repository after completion of the work. The metadata (e.g., title, abstract, authors, publisher, etc.) be freely accessible from the time of deposition of the content and their free unrestricted use through Open Access can be made after an embargo period not more than 12 months.

		All the journals published by the ICAR have been made Open Access.  Journals, conference proceedings and other scholarly literature published with the financial support from ICAR to the professional societies and others, to be made Open.

		The documents having material to be patented or commercialised, or where the promulgations would infringe a legal commitment by the institute and/or the author, may not be included in institute’s Open Access repository. However, the ICAR scientists and staff as authors of the commercial books may negotiate with the publishers to share the same via institutional repositories after a suitable embargo period.

Implementation
The DKMA to function as nodal agency for implementation of the ICAR Open Access policy. The DKMA will organize advocacy workshops and capacity building of scientific & technical personnel, repository administrators, editors and publishers on Institutional Repositories, application and usage of Free and Open Source Software.
End Note
OA initiative is not a single event. It is a process and expects full compliance over a period of three years.  Therefore, the proposed modest policy is a first step in the journey towards formal declaration of openness and then after reviews progress, compliance and impact periodically.

I participated in that.I worked on the tool that would try to help journalists and socially active people who are trying 
to make difference at ground level. Being in metros we have access good new papers like The Hindu, good internet access to visit different news sites. But if you go any tier II or III cities
and read the local news paper there then we do not see similar quality content. This is because journalists or people do not have access to technology by which they can backup their stories 
with relevant data. So the idea here is to get the data from government website like data.gov.in and list of policies government has implemented over time. And then try link them together to see what difference
those policies have made.What do you think about the idea ?Any suggestions and comments are welcome.A demo and detailed report about the event is at:-

We don't need a web server to host the maps either. A Github project page would suffice, since transit maps made with the library are completely client-side.That said, it would be great if we could start crowdsourcing routes and schedules, such as in a Gihub repository, so that we can have a pull-request-to-update workflow that enables us to easily edit them. The upside is that since we'd be editing them directly on the map's root directory, the transit map being rendered from that directory would be updated then and there, with each edit.I've already done this for the Chennai Suburban Railway, from the latest available PDFs of the schedules. Here are the links:The library itself, along with a preview and a tutorial on making a transit map.The Chennai Suburban Rail Map, in OpenStreetMap.The Chennai Suburban Rail Map, in Google Maps.The Repository of the Chennai Suburban Rail Map.A friend of mine is planning to start working on mapping the Hyderabad MMTS system, and if more people make transit maps, we'd have crowdsourced a large number of routes and schedules, and also made interactive maps in the process, with little to no extra effort other than for the route and schedule creation themselves.Feel free to mail me if you have questions. Eager to know if anyone's interested.Cheers,Pranav."

Subject: Looking for contacts involved with public procurement transparency in IndiaTo: Thejesh GN <i...@thejeshgn.com>Hi Thej,We met at TransparencyCamp earlier this year. As you might remember I am working on a set of case studies looking at the impacts of technology enabled transparency policies around the world. When we spoke the work was in a very preliminary and conceptual stage. Since then we settled on a course of study, and have been working on cases.
We decided to do a first set of four case studies on procurement transparency/disclosure and e-procurement systems.  Our first case was the Slovak Republic, which we published a few weeks ago here. One of the cases that we would like to do is State level procurement in Tamil Nadu, since as far as I have found it is one of two Indian states with a procurement transparency law.
I am trying to do a bunch of interviews with journalists, civic hackers, ngos, government officials or business people who work with procurement data, engage in procurement oversight or are in some other way connected to public procurement and corruption. I was hoping that you might have some suggestions as to who I could reach out to? National level players in this space are useful too, as they may be able to suggest local actors. 
Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!Best,Zander-- Alexander Furnas

Hello!
 
The International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) is excited to announce the launch of the
2013 McGraw-Hill Data Journalism program, which will train English and Spanish-speaking journalists who report for minority and other underserved populations on a variety of
 journalism tools and techniques, including how to mine economic and financial databases, and how to find, interpret, visualize and report on this data. The program will feature a free 8-week online course (in both English and Spanish) which is designed to
 be completed at your own pace, followed by an 8-week mentoring session, during which participants work individually with the course instructors to polish their stories they produce. The best stories will award the participants with a trip to New York City
 to interview and meet with recognized financial and economic experts.
 
We would appreciate it if you could share this opportunity with your colleagues and the rest of your professional network. There is no application fee.

 
The deadline to apply is
September 15, 2013.

Join us at AMP Camp 3 via our free live stream tomorrow Thursday thru Friday, Aug 29-30.

We’ve almost doubled the scope of last year's curriculum. We’ll cover both mature and bleeding-edge components of the open-source Berkeley Data Analytics Stack, including BlinkDB (bounded and approximate distributed queries), Mesos (cluster-level OS), MLbase (distributed Machine Learning), Shark (SQL at Scale), Spark (fast cluster compute engine), Tachyon (in memory file system), and more!

The AMP Camp 3 agenda mixes hands-on exercises with tutorial-style talks given by the folks who are actually writing the open source tools, and publishing the research behind them. Throughout the entire event, over a dozen PhD students and professors will be manning the classroom collaboration software to provide real-time help to folks tuned into the live stream (we’ll send you a link to enroll in the online classroom software after you register).

Register here and I’ll see you (or you’ll see us :-) at AMP Camp 3!

Andy & the AMP Camp team
P.S. Help us spread the word about the live stream by upvoting us on hackernews (search for “berkeley” - we just moved to the 2nd page)

Here's a quick email to decide the date for our August DataMeet-Up in Delhi.Which day in the 26-31 August week is suitable for you?
Does a weekday (we will begin at 6:30 pm) work better, or the weekend (say, Saturday 5 pm)?
Is Wednesday (28th) 6:30 pm better, or Saturday 5:00 pm?Please let us know.

Do share possible venues for the meeting too. One option is to organise it at the National Informatic Centre office in CGO Complex. The NDSAP-PMU (National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy - Project Management Unit) team has very graciously offered us meeting space there.


So this time we will begin with a few short presentations (maybe PechaKucha style?) from people working with open data in Delhi (including building tools), and then quickly get into chalking out an action plan for the Delhi chapter. The plan is to brainstorm and decide upon things we can do as a group, figure out who can and is willing to contribute to each of these tasks, and how can we carry them out (including organising resources, financial and otherwise).
And I promise to quickly edit/add to Nisha's notes from our last meeting and post it on the DataMeet blog.

Yes, let's do that. Also, we have a R User's group
that will be meeting that day. I would suggest that
we could fruitfully combine the two meetings. Let
me consult them, and I will post an announcement
in the next couple of days.

this time and day suits me , also just a heads up regarding http://in.pycon.org/2013/ so most of us are planning to be there a day in advance for the event in Bangalore . i expect a cross section of the community from Delhi leaving for this event. So either preponing it or postponing it something i am in favour of.
 
Please let us know.

having said that this is one discussion i want to be a part of so in wrost case if the meeting date is fixed on 31st , i will have to choose between leaving for Bangalore or sticking around since i have not booked my tickets as yet.

Unfortunately, I am out of town on the 24th.

On the other hand, I think that most FOSS user groups
in India are so weak and fragmented that it is always
better to try and bring them together. The R User's meeting
is already set for the afternoon of the 31st at our office,
but we can stagger the times if you would like.

If that format does not suit the material you will be presenting, you can keep your presentation below 5 minutes. I was thinking of 10 minutes per presentation with 5 minutes for the actual presentation and 5 minutes for discussion. I am doing some visualisation works for India Water Portal, and may present it at the 31st meeting too.That will mean 30 minutes of presentation, followed by an hour of discussion on the agendas and plan of action of the Delhi chapter.Bests,rijusumandroajantriks.net"

A lot of questions of what it means to be in datameet and what direction should this group take.  In the next few weeks it is important to look at how we want to use this space and what we want to get of it. And discuss it openly as we move forward. 
Here are the general notes:DataMeet BangaloreAgendaUpdatesAnnouncementsGroup Business- Trust
- What does it mean to be apart of datameet? - The Group is by and large good at sharing and also providing a more civic minded look at data. Some questions from discussion.--lot of information of what people get out of the data space
--self learning--what is going to contribute to society?--gov/ngo centered view of data - different view--what ppl are doing? what discussions are going on?--non gov view, india- centric view
--policy--knowledge to get new things- for information and knowledge--source of sources - consumer and producer of open data--open data in india - movement--what are other groups doing?
datameet- WHat should the Bangalore group focus in in the next six months. --policy and licensing --non technical conversations--drop the tech conversations--entice government to put out the data- primary objective
--outsourcing our exertise--encourage members to put out their data- - What does having one in Bangalore mean?- WHat are our values?--Goal for meeting - Agenda for next 6 months
--addresss the fear of putting it out--local governments - data out of them- literacy at the ward level----sharing--openness/accountability--civic awareness

There may be more paperwork in setting up a society, but it offers great advantages in the long term. Elections, simpler to change objectives, easy to dissolve, charging membership fees, etc.
Thoughts?Regards,

'Just days to save the RTI Act'' (Tuesday 6 August 2013)

We have just days to save the RTI Act.



	 



	 


Dear Friend,

	 



The most powerful law we have in India to fight corruption is going to be diluted soon. In the next few days, the Government will amend the RTI Act to ensure that political parties do not come under direct public scrutiny.

			 


The RTI community has been very vigilant and has managed to prevent any amendment of the RTI Act, despite attempts from as early as 2006, a year after its passage in Parliament. Since the RTI act came into effect it has proved to be a powerful means to fight corruption and the arbitrary use of power. The vigilance and protest by the RTI community kept the establishment from proceeding with the dormant and explicit desire to curtail transparency and accountability entitlements. We are now informed that the Government is thinking of moving amendments to the RTI Act in the coming session of Parliament, to negate the CIC order declaring that political parties are public authorities under the RTI Act. It is likely that these amendments will seek to not only address this issue but to curtail various other entitlements that have now established the ability of the RTI to fight corruption and the arbitrary use of power by the establishment.

				 


This is a huge setback for our nation. In order to remain free of corruption, all political parties should be transparent and answerable to the public. This won’t happen if the RTI Act is modified. It is time for us as people of this country to take action. Ask the Prime Minister (PM), Manmohan Singh, to save the RTI Act from amendments. Sign our petition.

			 

We hardly have any time to act. We need to showcase that the whole country is against this proposed dilution of RTI Act. If thousands sign this petition, the Government will know that there is growing public support, and that they cannot ignore this demand of their voters. 

			 

Help us get at least 25,000 signatures before we deliver them to the PM, the Cabinet Ministers and to prominent media houses. They need to know that Indian citizens deserve and demand clean, transparent politics.

			 

Each signature and every voice of the people of this country counts. Sign the petition and forward this email to your family and friends. Please share it on Facebook and Twitter.

			 

Thank you for taking action.

			 

On behalf of all Co-convenors of NCPRI,

Aruna Roy

[Bangalore] DataMeet this month: July 28th Sunday [1 Update]
Eradicating poverty requires a data revolution [1 Update]


 [Bangalore] DataMeet this month: July 28th Sunday

Nisha Thompson <nisha.t...@gmail.com> Jul 22 02:54PM +0530
        
      We are still on for the DataMeet at Microsoft research on Sunday July 28th.
 
This is our first time doing it on a Sunday. I have to confirm a time.
 
So if you could RSVP that would be helpful. There is a lot to discuss in
terms of group business so there might not be a project presentation this
time. IF someone does want to make a short presentation please let me know.
And I'll see if there is time.
 
Tentative Agenda:
Announcements
group business
larger strategy
Bangalore group strategy -
- how do we organize the meetups
Data.Gov.In Bangalore/Karnataka Instance
-requesting datasets
 
Thanks Everyone! Look forward to see you then!

 Eradicating poverty requires a data revolution

Rushabh Mehta <rme...@gmail.com> Jul 22 11:43AM +0530
        
      I hope it does not become another veil for the government to hide behind.
If you see our poverty indicators, we clearly know the regions and the
communities that are left behind. For example: UP, Bihar, Orissa. This
chart is particularly indicative:
 
http://codeformumbai.org/index.py?page=dataset&fname=Shortfall_In_Health_Infra_As_Per_2011_Population_Prov_In_India_2.csv
 
What clearly lacks is the ""conviction"" to tackle poverty or in other words
- to create basic infrastructure and assets (roads, school, hospitals,
power plants) in the regions that need them the most. If you read papers
like Mint, you get the impression that FDI is the most important topic in
our national agenda.
 
I would love to see a newspaper that collects, prints poverty statistics by
region, community on a month by month basis and actively tracks creation of
community assets.

Agenda:updatesgroup businesslarger strategydelhi group strategy - - how do we organize the meetups NIC - delhi instance
-requesting datasetsSaatya - Working with NICNIC's Data.gov.in New site will launch next month. There will be more functionality and it will be SAIS enabled so that new instances can be made for states and cities easily. 
It will be separate from other data management systems and could be another option from ckan and socrata.They will ramp up on social, communication, and communityGroup Business
DataMeet becoming Trust. Current problems we are trying to fix.Google group now at 600 members - Email lists don't grow well how do we keep the momentum going and keep the discussion on the group useful.
- build out website where we have a place for events, projects, information in one placePeople are asking for support for individual projects and also asking if there is a place where they can find projects they can work on.
- market place of ideas and projects where people can put their idea and find people to work on it. And also access funds to get the project finished.Getting groups started in new places- interest in having a datameet in other cities but having a hard time getting started.
Events - Data related events are on teh rise. We can do focused events on how to work with open data and how we can make it usefulSkill building- people want more skill building events we can help organize and publicize them. 
Big QuestionsHow do we better organize groups across the country?what is datameet work?two or three things that datameet doeshow do we measure the output of the group
what are the two or three problems we are trying to fix?access data from governmenthelping people use that data. how do you get it?what do you do with it?
what does datameet mean for delhi?more exposure to different groups especially non technology organizationsDatameet while is not great at providing useful project output based events. It is really helpful when understanding the diversity of what is happening. When you go to a datameet you learn about what is going on in data in India. 
Useful things we can dolist of sources they can share data - directory of dataBuild out narratives and instructions on; what it means to be an open data organizations?we share lots of things

What does one need to study to become a data scientist?3. How many data scientists do companies have? Are there enough data scientists today?

2732,Ajay Kelkar,#topic/datameet/1k8AKIx1gIU,2,2013-07-24 10:22:00,Re: [datameet] Questions on data scientists,"ShraddhaI run an analytics company called Hansa Cequity & before this I was the CMO for HDFC bank. Been in the analytics arena now for over a decade.Here are my thoughts to your questions...you can also access some of my writing at my blog:  http://blog.cequitysolutions.com
Here is my response:1. What do companies look for while hiring data scientists? It is easy for jargon to be invented. Data scientist is yet another example.  The discipline of
“data scientist” is often interpreted in many different ways. Almost as if it were
like the story about the “blind man & the elephant”. Analysts or Data scientists are most
impactful when they are focusing on “taking effective decisions rather than sexy
insight”. That is my perspective. To make effective decisions you need to
influence people with insight & therefore Data scientsits must become
“storytellers with data”. While technical aspects of Analytics are important,
the value can be realized only if these “storytellers” influence key decisions
within a company.So there is this huge gap between talking about analytics & being able to 
actually make a large impact on business. And so Data science is a sexy & much hyped area but it needs a lot of ""hard
 work"" to make it happen on the ground. 2. What does one need to study to become a data scientist?Amidst all this hype about Data scientists, where does “good old analysis” 
feature? People seem to be excited about algorithms & sexy stuff! 
Where is the “good old analyst” who is plain good at analysis & may 
not know fancy tools & technology . Where is the value for intelligence 
& not for knowing technology? In this hype about “big data”, are we 
getting lost in the bigness of things! Can analytics be “reinvented” to 
just become more intelligent & practical? The word  Analysis means 
to “let loose”(from the greek-“ana” meaning “up” & ""lyein"" meaning 
“loosen. So Analysis is supposed to loosen up a complex problem into 
simpler parts. But are analysts gearing up for this or are they raring 
to just learn SAS or SPSS? It might seem contradictory, but are 
intelligent people actually getting attracted to Analytics or Data science? Analytics doesn’t need you to solve a technical problem but a 
“business & social” problem. And most Business analysts have not 
spent much time in business roles. They are super specialised number 
crunchers without a sufficient exposure to business reality. Even if the
 managers have some exposure to business through experience across a 
variety of analytics projects, is it enough? Does this bring the analytics career into some jeopardy? Would analysts be able to grow in companies beyond a level or is it a parallel consulting stream only?
Analysts need to “Story tell” to embed analytics into the fabric of 
the company. But analysts are too one-dimensional & not embracing 
the intersection of “technology, statistics & business”. So analysts
 struggle to tell stories. Often I see journalists do a far better job 
with infographics in media. But information journalists are not wanting a
 career as Data scientists & so there is a gap in “story telling”.3.
 How many data scientists do companies have? Are there enough data 
scientists today? Or are we going to face a crunch soon (I read McKinsey
 and NASSCOM reports that say we will)?Reports talk of a large gap. But can be addressed by thinking about data science in a more integrative way.  My view is that if we are looking at people at the intersection of technology, statistics & business & if we agree that all three are important then the gap is definitely there.
4. How is the industry building a base or trying to develop or train more people to become data scientists?
Analytics is too theoretical. Not enough integration with systems has happened to push decisions to the point at which consumers interact
 with the business. This is far easier to do in new Online businesses 
which have built their systems around this capability. CIOs & 
technology teams in large existing offline businesses don’t see this as 
important.Average age of employees
 in online business is far lower. Younger people are adopting analytics 
far faster. They are getting exposed to it in their education & they
 are consuming it through their “digital avatars”. They see this often 
as a “no brainer”. Older executives are harder to convert to this line 
of thinking.7.
 The Harvard Business Review called being a data scientist the sexiest 
job in the 21st century. Is it really as cool a job as it is made out to
 be?The problem with analytics is that sometimes it becomes an ivory tower! Also to many people who don't spend all their time crunching data, Analytics is boring!
But journalism is showing some wonderful examples of how analytics 
& visualization can connect economics & everyday life in 
interesting ways. Data & analysis need not be boring!
I continue to believe that this trend of “Information journalists” is what we must bring into the analytics practise in the corporate world. Make data interesting & actionable & you will see adoption go up like crazy!
Hope this helps...& hope you enjoy writing the story!Cheers
Ajay

What do companies look for while hiring data scientists?     See Pg36 for the kinds of skills needed2. What does one need to study to become a data scientist?    Depends how you define ""data scientist"", the definition should be ""analytics"" and Pg5 lists the key fields of study.3. How many data scientists do companies have? Are there enough data scientists today? Or are we going to face a crunch soon (I read McKinsey and NASSCOM reports that say we will)?    Estimates vary because of the definition issue.    Currently no special gap in India (we have the general gap of not finding well-educated people).    Reports ignore the effect of automation & productivity increases on the headcount forecast.4. How is the industry building a base or trying to develop or train more people to become data scientists?    Education courses in the usual educational institutes    Certification offered by INFORMS.org    In-house education/training5. Why has this field suddenly become so popular?    It is a huge gap    The IT vendors need the next big market to make money from    Google & Facebook showed people the value of analytics & released key tools to open source6.

If you see our poverty indicators, we clearly know the regions and the communities that are left behind. For example: UP, Bihar, Orissa. This chart is particularly indicative:
http://codeformumbai.org/index.py?page=dataset&fname=Shortfall_In_Health_Infra_As_Per_2011_Population_Prov_In_India_2.csv
What clearly lacks is the ""conviction"" to tackle poverty or in other words - to create basic infrastructure and assets (roads, school, hospitals, power plants) in the regions that need them the most. If you read papers like Mint, you get the impression that FDI is the most important topic in our national agenda.
I would love to see a newspaper that collects, prints poverty statistics by region, community on a month by month basis and actively tracks creation of community assets.

Delivering news to the user (where we create value with UI/UX),2. Personalizing the news based on user interests (here our alogs create value)and3. Souring news (RSS feeds) from thousands & ten thousands of blogs.We have worked considerable on (1) and (2) to create value for the user and now need to solve (3). The 3rd part of the problem has been solved many times and we dont believe there is much value for us to create here. There are many sites offering services - such as syndic8 (for some reason APIs are not working though), spinn3r, newsisfree, google feeds, etc; and usually are paid.We are looking to reduce our expenditure. Some possible ways to do that would be,1. Using an open source software to which we can add a lot of RSS feeds (under different topics). The software should ideally have the functionality for clustering similar stories in a topic, do some spam filtering, be able to arrange topics (based on the interest they have generated), etc. We will put this OSS software on AWS, as we dont expect fetching and updating feeds to cost sufficient bandwidth.2. We are open to other suggestions aswell.Thanks."

Would any of you have any recommendations on how to go about this?I'm essentially trying to make the argument that housing finance products that cater to untenured households fill a critical gap that is currently unserved.

2786,Amitangshu,#topic/datameet/XofwPzQwUTA,1,2013-07-01 20:51:00,Data Journalism article on Scidev,"A nice article on titled ""Data journalism: how to find stories in
numbers"" by Sandra Crucianelli.

I like this quote

“Evidence suggests that data journalism is the journalism of the future”

""Data journalism: how to find stories in numbers"" by Sandra Crucianelli.

Colleagues often ask me what data journalism is. They're confused by
why it needs its own name — don't all journalists use data?

The term is shorthand for 'database journalism' or 'data-driven
journalism', where journalists find stories, or angles for stories,
within large volumes of data.

It overlaps with investigative journalism in requiring lots of
research, sometimes against people's wishes. It can also overlap with
data visualisation, as it requires close collaboration between
journalists and digital specialists to find the best ways of
presenting data.

So why get involved with spreadsheets and visualisation tools? At its
most basic, adding data can give a story a new, factual dimension. But
delving into datasets can also reveal new stories, or new aspects to
them, that may not have otherwise surfaced.

Data journalism can also sometimes tell complicated stories more
easily or clearly than relying on words alone — so it's particularly
useful for science journalists.

It can seem daunting if you're trained in print or broadcast media.
But I'll introduce you to some new skills, and show you some excellent
digital tools, so you too can soon find your feet as a data
journalist.

Where to begin

Like all journalism, ideas for stories can come from many sources. A
statistic might not sound quite right, tempting you to look at the
data behind it. Or you might have a question to answer — how has
science funding changed in the UK?, for example.

One way data journalism differs from other forms is that you may have
no inkling of the story until well after you start investigating. That
doesn't mean getting hold of any old data and expecting to find a
story — rather that the story is what the data tells you. This
presentation on The Guardian's Datablog gives an idea of the workflow
in data journalism.

So how do you choose what to delve into? It's good to familiarise
yourself with data types and sources in your 'beats' and when that
data might be released, just as you would know conference or journal
publication dates.

It's best to start small with your first data journalism projects,
particularly while you get used to the data processing and using all
the available tools. Your main challenge will probably be the time
needed to process data. Peter Aldhous, the New Scientist San Francisco
bureau chief, has produced a tutorial on how to approach science data
journalism projects, and The Data Journalism Handbook also has tips on
where to start.

Finding and accessing data

Data journalism experts say that journalists' roles are changing from
hunting and gathering scarce information to processing information in
'an age of abundance'.

“Evidence suggests that data journalism is the journalism of the future”

Sandra Crucianelli

Data might be abundant, but some types of data are easier to get hold
of than others. Governments are beginning to recognise the importance
of releasing data — including research findings — but this varies from
country to country, and even a government that believes in openness
may lack adequate systems for making data accessible.

Some nations, such as Kenya, proactively make data available, while in
others you'll have to ask — sometimes through systems such as India's
Right to Information Act.

International bodies such as the World Bank release data, and projects
such as Gapminder and Google Public Data Explorer collate data from
various organisations. For science/health journalists,
clinicaltrials.gov is a registry of clinical trial data. And
environment or earth science reporters can access information from the
US Geological Survey, for example.

You might even find some ready packaged data at your disposal. Data
Dredger, a collaboration between Internews and Kenya's open government
data initiative, provides links to Kenyan health reports and has
infographics on health topics you can download and use in stories.

And the web is full of data — finding it just requires honing your
search engine skills. Sometimes you can just search for a term plus
'data', or use a specialised academic search engine such as Google
Scholar or Scirus. 'Semantic' web resources, such as Wolfram|Alpha,
which search by extra data, not just the keywords within the page, are
also useful.

Google's advanced search allows you to narrow your results by domain
extension, helping you to search for academic or government data, and
file format — such as the Excel files in which you're most likely to
find tables of figures or statistics. Tables and graphics are often
uploaded as an image, so your data hunt should include Flickr and
Google Images.

You can even retrieve data that have been deleted from the web but
were 'cached' or saved as screenshots. Try the Internet Archive and
its Wayback Machine to recover old files or broken URLs.

Social media can also be a data source. Tools such as
SocialMention,48ers, Twitterfall Addictomatic, Boardreader and
Whostalkin allow you to make searches by name, subject, time and
geo-reference. An interesting example of social networks revealing
news is the Eye on the Bailoutproject of ProPublica, an investigative
journalism organisation, which has used social media mentions to alert
journalists to new data on what has happened to the US 2008 bank
bailout money.

Remember — it's good practice to link to, or state the sources of, your data.

Data handling

You've found the data, but can you use it? You'll need to import it
into a spreadsheet such as those in Excel or Google Drive, so download
data in a 'comma separated value', or CSV, format if possible.

You might have a table in a PDF file, or as a JPEG image file. Try a
file converter like Zamzar to get these into spreadsheets. Optical
character recognition software can also be a big help: a simple, free
one is Free Ocr. As a last resort you may have to manually input data,
which is time consuming and error prone.

Wherever your data comes from, it probably needs 'cleaning' to make it
useful. This can mean anything from reorganising and deleting data you
don't need, to using tools such as OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine)
to make the data more consistent (watch the video tutorials for
guidance on what this cleaning can mean). Science journalists at least
should have access to well-kept scientific data that needs less
cleaning.

You'll also need to start doing some basic processing. You might sort
data from smallest to largest or by location. You might be looking for
averages, or to join or compare two datasets.

Treat data as a 'source': ask it questions as your audience might. And
ask it lots of questions — the answer might not be what you first
think. For example, a spreadsheet of journal retractions might suggest
rising fraud detection, but you also need to ask whether there are
other interpretations.

Think carefully about your results — do they sound plausible? It's
best to check and recheck calculations. Don't ruin your reputation for
a basic error.

You can strengthen your conclusions or pinpoint new questions with
simple statistical analyses. For example, you might spot more
catastrophic storms in your country each year for 20 years. But is
this a significant result or might it be chance natural variation?
Tools such as the R-Project and RStudio can help you judge that. You
might also want to check your conclusions with experts or other
experienced data journalists, particularly when you're starting out.

Presenting the data

Your presentation will depend on the story. There may be very little
to present; you could have slaved to get a single but important figure
to report in a conventional news piece — that your government has
spent half what it promised on science, for example.

Or you might use data visualisation as an integral part of the story.
Thisinvestigation from The Seattle Times in the United States combines
a written feature with supporting graphs, maps and source documents.
One is an interactive map; elements like this can be used within
larger stories and projects, or can be self-contained, like this
visualisation of the causes of death hosted by the UK newspaper The
Guardian.

Online tools such as Tableau Public and Many Eyes can visualise data
in various ways, while Google Fusion Tables, Geocommons and
Indiemapperproduce good maps using longitude/latitude data or more
complex GIS data. Many of these tools also let you add an animation
layer to show timescales, for example.

Sometimes it's not just about presenting data, but letting your
audience see what it means to them. This ProPublica project shows
users whether their doctor receives drug company money, while this
Texas Tribuneeffort shows you how US public money is spent.

Going further, this Guardian project asks readers to help analyse data
on UK public spending. This kind of project, called a 'news app',
requires collaboration between journalists and programmers to design
and build applications that handle and analyse many variables within
big databases or across many datasets.

I've been involved in a news app at Argentina's La Nación newspaper as
part of my Knight International Journalism Fellowship. It uses
national census information from 2001 and 2010, letting people explore
how demographics have changed in their areas.

The website Information is Beautiful has examples of creative data
visualisation, and shows how working with your publication's digital
or graphics team can be productive.

You may need to persuade your editors to make time for data
journalism. This gets easier when you see results, and this report
(which I co-authored) on integrating data journalism into newsrooms
might also help.

It might seem like a big ask, but evidence suggests that data
journalism is the journalism of the future. If you can invest the
time, you'll not only get better stories but you'll better serve your
audience and the public interest.

If you have the data---at least counts and locations---producing
a map is easy. Ideally, the data would also include boundaries
for administrative areas in Bangalore, but it might be possible
to find that information from other sources.

yes in the context you have mentioned the bosses perceive things in very different ways , in fact the people who collect do not have any clue why they are doing it also its a painful and laborious jobs of collecting then trying to make a meaning out it all, many a times i have seen the so called numbers have been manupulated too .

What do you want to extract from these? Unfortunately, the
Bangla text is not in Unicode, and thus it would take significant
time and effort to convert that. However, if you can describe

Actually, I think that it will *have* to be done through the
Government of India, and the people running data.gov.in
It is just too difficult for third-party developers to do this
in a consistent manner that will keep working in the future:
Please see below.

[...]

Architecture, tools, etc., are not that complicated. One
could start with a system that parses the current spreadsheets,
digests the data, and provides an API. However, there are
several issues with third parties doing this:
1. While several people have done specific case studies by
    manually extracting the data from the spreadsheet files,
    this is obviously not something that can scale.
2. It is possible to build a system that enlists the help of people
    interested in specific datasets. For example, a prototype of
    such a system would parse the first few lines of any given
    spreadsheet file, make an educated guess about data types,
    and allow the user to modify the guesses.
3. Such crowd-sourcing might work at one level, but a big
    problem is that:
    (a) There is no consistent standard followed by the spreadsheets.
         E.g., at least names of states, and date formats could
         be standardised.
    (b) Several of the spreadsheets that we looked at have
         internally inconsistent data. Please see the issues
         brought up by Supreet at
         http://www.mail-archive.com/ilugd@lists.linux-delhi.org/msg29943.html
4. Finally, there is the question of what incentive there is for
    third-party developers to build such an API?
       For sustainability, this either has to be done by a publicly-
    funded institution or there has to be a commercial basis for it.
    If it is done through public funds, why should data.gov.in not
    handle it themselves?
       There might well be a business case in selling access to such
    an API, but the cost of developing the API and hosting the
    services will be quite high. However, I cannot seem to find any
    indication on the data.gov.in sites as to whether such third-
    party, commercial access is allowed. In fact, I could not find
    any information on the terms of usage of the data published
    there.

Not sure what you mean by this response. ""The process""
of what?

A third possibility exists besides the two that I mentioned
in my earlier message: That of having an open-source
group that does this, where the incentive for doing the
development for free is recognition. However, the hosting
costs will still be high. My opinion also is that given the
current strength and abilities of open-source communities
in India, even development in this manner will be very
difficult.

Agreed. As you mentioned, and as I also believe, the technology
is the relatively easy part.

Well, here we will have to agree to disagree.

IMHO, this particular problem is of a scale and complexity that
cannot easily be addressed in a voluntary context. One might be
able to build a prototype, or even a working system, using open-
source volunteers working free of cost (personally, I think that
even this will be very difficult given the current status in India).
However, sustaining it is not something that can be done without
significant funding. Just the hosting costs will run into at least a
couple lakhs/year at any reasonable scale.

Here is a brief agenda for the meeting:1. Update on data.gov.in activities from Satyakam.
2. Update on the 'Opening Government Data by Mediation: Exploring the Roles, Practices and Strategies of Data Intermediary Organisations in India' project by Sumandro/Zainab.
3. [add further updates]
4. Setting the future agenda for DataMeet Foundation/Trust, and the next set activities in Delhi.
Satyakam (Goswami), Nasr (ul Hadi) and I had a brief discussion about collaborations between DataMeet and Hacks/Hackers. It would be great if Nasr and other members of Hacks/Hackers can also join us on 19th.


For those who, like me, missed the last DataMeet-Up, here are the meeting notes by Satya and Nasr: <http://datameet.org/2013/05/16/datameet-up-in-delhi-friday-31-may/>
Also, I will soon share the invitation to the panel discussion on 'Open Data and Developing Countries' mentioned above.

This sounds incredibly promising. Thanks for sharing this and I look
forwrad to the attending the meeting on the 16th. As far as venue for
datameet is concerned, Isha and I can offer the conference room at the
Akvo office in Yusuf Sarai.

However, twenty does seem like a daunting number, and some of us may
have to fight it out for some precious elbow space :-) If that's not a
problem for others, then we would love to host the July Delhi Datameet
at Akvo office. Also, since this means we will have to steal chairs
from our colleagues, if people trickle in between 6:15-6:30 it will
make it slightly easier for us to get logistics in place :-)

Â If Tim and Michael are available for the 18th/20th, can then the
datameet be shifted accordingly? Our venue offer stands firm for any
of these dates.

Cheerio

The date sounds good. As the venue seems to have
been a problem in the past, we can volunteer our office
which is located near the Green Park Metro: Â http://goo.gl/maps/OrH0k
Comfortable for 10 people, and 20 can squeeze in
with some discomfort. Wireless, chai, and snacks
available.

The other possibility, where I have attended events
of some other meetup.com groups is the YMCA
tourist hostel near CP. They have sizeable conference
rooms on rent. Not sure of the prices, but they
should be reasonable as the other groups were
funding it by charging Rs. 100 from each of 40-50
attendees, which includes a room that can hold
some 70 people, water, and chai.

In this study, we are trying to map how non-government and advocacy organisations collect, store, publish, use and re-use data. We are also attempting to understand the usage scenarios imagined by and implementation challenges faced by policy-makers and data portal implementors. This mapping is being done to identify possible areas of policy modification, capacity building, community organisation, and alignment of efforts.
This study is part of the 'Exploring Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing Countries' (ODDC) research network managed by World Wide Web Foundation and supported by the Canadian International Development Research Centre.
You can read more about the study on the research blog, and about the ODDC research network at the Open Data Research Network website.
We are carrying out an initial survey to identify organisations in India that function as 'data/information intermediaries', i.e., those who mediate between creators/publishers of data and users of data, either by mandate or in the way they work.
If your organisation undertakes such data/information mediations or simply collects and publishes government data, please visit the survey page and register your organisation for an in-depth survey that we will undertake during the next months.

I do not know about the way you are getting the satellite data.

You will need to have some idea about the topography of the place
beforehand (you can proceed on the raw data otherwise too but this
would make things easier) : this will help you with generation of the
training set.

What kind of things are you looking for ?
Make a list.
Can you point them out manually: if this is on target you will have no
real problems.

Even with Bayesian learning techniques you can get great maps.

GNU/R + (views :machine learning + bayes) + grass gis

Rest should be easy.

Also you can get information about the methodology they adopted.You can definitely use remotely sensed data for your study to1. Create shapefiles, using satellite images as base.2. using DEM to delineate catchment area You can use recent satellite images (either from NRSC or Landsat) which are available at a price.or, you can use freely available old images.-Prabhanjan"

Announcing the Global Open Data Initiative
June 12, 2013 in
Uncategorized<http://globalopendatainitiative.org/category/uncategorized/>

*As partners we are extremely excited to announce the Global Open Data
Initiative (GODI); an action to share principles and resources for
governments and societies on how to best harness the opportunities created
by opening government data.*

With this initiative we intend to provide a roadmap of policies and
institutions that governments can use to build meaningful new open data
reforms and initiatives, based on the successes of others. The formalized
collaboration is motivated by the fact that each of our organizations are
in different and complementary ways focused on developing tools and ideas
to help build locally and globally sustainable open data ecosystems.
Putting our strengths and networks together in the Global Open Data
Initiative is a natural step towards intensifying these efforts.

At this point we are still in an early stage, but have identified six key
areas of action:

   - Serve as a global guiding voice on open data issues
   - Provide a leading vision for how governments approach open data
   - Increase awareness of open data
   - Support the development of the global open data community
   - Amplify and broaden the evidence base for open data
   - Gather and strengthen existing resources

Read more in detail about these areas in the Our Work
section<http://globalopendatainitiative.org/2013/06/12/announcing-the-global-open-data-initiative/>


.

Announcing the Global Open Data Initiative has been publicized in
variations on all partner blogs: Web
Foundation<http://www.webfoundation.org/2013/06/announcing-the-global-open-data-initiative-godi/>


, Sunlight Foundation<http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/06/11/announcing-the-global-open-data-initiative/>

I think it can be calculated over a period of 30 or 40 or 50 or 100 years (not sure). IMD calls it the LPA (Long Period Average) and is calculated over a period of 50 years between 1951-2000 (I could see 1941-1990 used somewhere. I wish someone could clarify :-) ).
IMD also classifies whether the monsoon is normal or not based on this LPA. +/-10% of LPA is Normal. (see http://www.imd.gov.in/doc/termglossary.pdf. Lots of definitions there)
It would be interesting to have that 10% band on the rainfall tracker, and to highlight the drought years in Red or such colour.On similar terms, in the erratic months graph, it would be great to have the respective normal bands for the months so that we can see how erratic the rainfall actually is.

The hacknight will begin with a tutorial by renowned hadoop practitioner, Gopal Vijayaraghavan, who will help participants to get a single node cluster up and running on their laptops with the help of a few convenience scripts, pre-packaged config files and some hand-holding. 
You will learn how to set up a very simple, non-secure hadoop cluster which will let you dig deeper into the architecture and understand how and when to  modify hadoop to suit your needs. 
Please bring datasets and problems which they you can work with using hadoop. You are encouraged to work with a range of stacks: R, Pig, Hive, Python and Java. Learn how and when R on Hadoop to fits your problem or how to use Pig to get a quick ETL phase and cut down your logs to size. Check your A/B tests and funnels with Hive.  
This hacknight is open to individuals who want to work with hadoop, on hadoop and everything in the neighbourhood. Come prepared with a laptop, a github account, java skills and enough sleep to tide you over the night.

CIA detainees since 9/11

Here's a quick synopsis from their website:

""The Rendition Project has begun an ambitious initiative to 'map' the
global rendition system, providing a detailed analysis of its
component parts and a clearer understanding of how they fit together.
The focus has been on tracking the movement of CIA flights around the
world, and individual detainees as they have been transferred between
secret prisons for continued detention and torture.""

This is being now used by U.K media to bring out a lot of stories on
illegal detention. They are compiling this data from accessible
sources and visualizing this using tableau. They have got a lot of
attention of late.

Dear all,

Happy to bump into this mailing list. Is anyone interested in a meetup in Mumbai - the last one I searched was almost a year ago?

A quick intro: We had participated in the recent Planning Commission hackathon. When we saw the data.gov.in site, we realized that there must be a better way to visualize all this data. So we came up with http://codeformumbai.org (repository: https://github.com/codeformumbai/data-gov-in).

The goal is to create a data portal that can merge all the datasources based on some heuristics (here is a start I did for the data.gov.in files: https://github.com/codeformumbai/data-gov-in/blob/master/build_db.py). I was able to map almost 60% datapoints to timeseries and 30% to a region. And this is just the start - there is the awesome devinfo census database. Would also love to find ways to map election data into this so that it could be useful in the up coming elections. Also if we can map the governance architecture (governments, departments, ministries, institutions) then it will make for even interesting analysis.

Since I am a newbie in this field would love to meet more experienced folks, get ideas for visualisations, share datasources, tools. If there are any similar projects (did not find many so far) please let me know.

best regards,
Rushabh

I glanced through the TAG-UP report (http://finmin.nic.in/reports/tagup_report.pdf) on which this article is based. Some of the conclusions of the article are laughable, specially when it says ""The UIDAI will be a business entity, governed by the Companies Act; not bound by a law that will recognise the fiduciary role of the state..."" Now, how does the writer conclude this?!The report says, government should outsource more IT (which it is already doing via NSDL and other such PSUs) and create a framework to create such (Information Utilities) companies so that the process can be standardised instead of re-inventing the wheel all the time.No where I could find that ownership of personal or biometric data is to be transferred to these entities. Infact there is an entire chapter that talks about privacy issues and how to address them.Interestingly the report talks about using Open Standards and forward looking concepts like crowd-sourcing and self-correcting architectures.There are no doubt concerns about privacy and misuse of data but there are huge benefits too. Its sorry to a high quality publication like the Hindu publish such blatantly one-sided and dishonest articles.best,Rushabh

The map is based on the pdf file (attached).Â process of conversion: opened pdf in inkscape. save as svg. lots of cleaning.
The 'Karnataka-AC.svg' file is the unfilled map which you can manipulate with javascript/python (or any other language). The 'KA-AC-coloured.svg"" is color coded according to party wins in the latest election. Blue is INC, green is BJP, orange is JDS and the rest are grey.
The Id element on each svg path is the AC constituency number, so thats the key by which you can color each path etcI am also attaching the mapping between ACs, PCs, and districts though most of you must have it already...but this is just in case (its the excel file).
the rule with AC-PC-district mapping is that ACs are always contained in a district . No AC can break a district boundary. PCs (comprised of a number of ACs) can break district boundaries.
The xls mapping attached should help in creating not just AC and PC maps, but also district maps. Â hope you find this useful. one last caveat. you use this at your own risk. i put this together in one day so please please check to see if i have made any mistakes in naming of ACs etc...if you do find a mistake please do mention it to the group.

 Meetup in Mumbai?
rushabh <rme...@gmail.com> May 15 02:28AM -0700  Dear all, Happy to bump into this mailing list. Is anyone interested in a meetup in Mumbai - the last one I searched was almost a year ago?
 A quick intro: We had participated in the recent Planning Commission hackathon. When we saw the data.gov.in site, we realized that there must be a better way to visualize all this data. So we came up with http://codeformumbai.org (repository: https://github.com/codeformumbai/data-gov-in). 
 The goal is to create a data portal that can merge all the datasources based on some heuristics (here is a start I did for the data.gov.in files: https://github.com/codeformumbai/data-gov-in/blob/master/build_db.py). I was able to map almost 60% datapoints to timeseries and 30% to a region. And this is just the start - there is the awesome devinfo census database. Would also love to find ways to map election data into this so that it could be useful in the up coming elections. Also if we can map the governance architecture (governments, departments, ministries, institutions) then it will make for even interesting analysis.
 Since I am a newbie in this field would love to meet more experienced folks, get ideas for visualisations, share datasources, tools. If there are any similar projects (did not find many so far) please let me know.
 best regards,Rushabh

And will allow the group to do more diverse events, like skill building workshops. 
Given that we are a volunteer group, getting support for these events is really difficult and involves a lot of work for the people organizing them. The plus side of forming a Trust is that we have an entity that can take money and save some juggling from the organizers. 
This is a major step for us as a group. So it's important to know what everyone is thinking. It will also be something that will be discussed at Bangalore's DataMeet this week. 
Do you think it is a good idea for us to become more formal?Do you think a Trust is best?What other things can we do as an official entity besides throw events? 
As we try to figure out the nuts and bolts of filling out paperwork and getting it worked out. Do any of you have any particular experience with forming a Trust? Any advice to give regarding how to proceed. That would be really helpful.

Finally! Yes. I think it is a good idea. I do not think the group is
becoming more formal just that we are creating a formal structure to
carry out activities of this group, informal as hey may be. The formal
structure is important - to do thing that only entities can do
especially around creating events and partnerships etc.

> Do you think a Trust is best?

Depends on many things. In general, a trust has a lower level of
administrative work as it just has a set of trustees. A society is
more inclusive and can have members and what not but then there is the
whole thing of elections etc. I see no need for the latter and am
happy with it being a trust.

> What other things can we do as an official entity besides throw events?

Create partnerships. Build brands. Raise money. Hire people. Et. al.

For me there a couple of reasons to do a trust, but being incubated is also a good option. Events are great but they are incredibly time and people resource heavy. Without an organization it makes a lot of the logistics much harder to organize.  Also we want these events to stay local and decentralized, however, not every group has the resources to pull off a datacamp and it can be hard to find sponsors. 
I have attached a document I wrote awhile ago about a sponsorship structure that could be helpful to people who want to have these datameets in their local area. Please review and let me know what you think. 
Also events around data are now becoming more common place. I know Bangalore is very over saturated with tech events. Our data events need to be more focused.  We can no longer get away with HEY DATA EVENT COME AND SAY DATA A LOT!  
Which is a really really good thing. As a group we have a particular point of view and what we feel are the strengths and weaknesses of data and open data. So I feel we can do explore a lot of interesting and innovative approaches that few other places can. 
One question that I would like to tackle in the next few months is: As a group do we have goals? Right now we are a space that allows conversations and sharing to happen, I consider that to be a great success. But now that we are growing, more avenues for finding ways to help move this productive energy forward will be necessary.  I think an organization will help with that.

I am also looking for people who want to donate time developing tools to manage data. 
Some of the people I work with:  CGNet Swara, The Mojolab Foundation and हैकरgram

I also want to apologize about the new moderation policy that I didn't let everyone know about. Since we are now a larger list spam has been an issue. So any first time messages are moderated.

This is why I joined the list to look for others to help us work out any data problems we encounter.Sincerely,Nisha

Hi

      I work for a non-profit in Kotagiri, The Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu
      called the Keystone Foundation. I am also working as part of the
      data team in the India Water Portal. I am interested in opening up
      data collected by non-profits and also leveraging open data for
      development. I find the energy and enthusiasm of the people on
      this group amazing and inspiring. I am interested in data analysis

so let's organise the DataMeet-Up Delhi on 24th May at 5 pm.

we have two venues in Green Park to choose from: (1) Mitango Technologies office, and (2) Akvo office.

as for the topic(s) to focus on this time, Satya's email seems to suggest that we should focus on plans for actually building apps/visualisations.

i am game with that. let's brainstorm on couple of apps/visualisations that we can build collaboratively (i guess in multiple teams). the ideas can involve data from individual organisations as well as from the government (available on data.gov.in or elsewhere).
it will be nice to start creating a list of datasets that we can request as a group to be made available on data.gov.in.
further, i think it is very important that we use our presence in delhi to ask the government of NCT of delhi to pass a NDSAP-equivalent policy. maybe we can do a brief brainstorming on that as well.
so the delhi members of the list, please respond quickly about your preference regarding the venues and suitability of the date and time.

Mintango Technologies
M-161/1B, Third floor,
Kalka Bhawan
Gujjar Diary

my interests  are varied from analytics to the technologies used in the
field , more from the applications side of things ,i am ok to have a
conversation around it apart from the usual  things like organization
development and community building , we can reach out and talk to other
users groups like R user group in Delhi , also we can have a Job corner
where people who are looking for people in the field can interact for
potential collaborations. This can be extended to a Job board on the
datameet website itself

Description:
""EFLGlobal is geared towards increasing access to finance by equipping banks in emerging markets with better tools to understand credit risk.  We are a for-profit spin-off from a Harvard research initiative  Our psychometric credit-scoring tool has lowered defaults and dramatically increased the SME loan portfolios of many of the largest banks in 25 countries across Africa, Latin America, and India.""(www.eflglobal.com)
Most entrepreneurs and small businesspersons in India and other emerging economies are ""un-bankable"" - they do not have access to the formal financial sector.  We firmly believe, however, that their are many ""hidden assets"" that an entrepreneur in an emerging market can use - we started by pioneering psychometric credit scoring and now seek to add additional sources of data to our scoring model to continue to enhance our predictive algorithms.
We are seeking partners who can help us understand the following data sources in India and other emerging markets:
1. Social Data - Look at what variables from the social web can help understand payment risk.
2. Mobile - Explore how pre-paid mobile usage, airtime top up patterns, and voice and SMS usage are predictive of credit risk and ability to pay. 
3. GIS - we have (fuzzy) address or GPS coordinates for bank applicants and seek to layer this data set with secondary data including point of interest data (e.g. distance from market), block and administrative level data. Market research companies have traditionally pioneered in this area and we particular we are hopeful about improvements in being able to geo-code fuzzy addresses, we are seeking those with geo-coding ability and access to data sets beyond census data (e.g. Pitney Bowes insights, axiom)""

Workshop on
 
Open Data Development and Transparency Initiatives
 
(May 9, 2013)
 
Dear Friends,
 
The World Bank, New Delhi in partnership with Central Library, Jawaharlal Nehru University(JNU) is organizing one day workshop on `Open Data – Open Development’ on May 9, 2013 from 10:00 -16:00 in Lecture Hall-I, JNU Convention Centre.


 
 
 
Prologue
 
Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)  and the World Bank is organizing  one day workshop on `Open Data Development Initiatives’ of the World Bank on May 9, 2013.
 
Transparency, accountability and citizen participation are all at the forefront of the World Bank’s citizen-centered development approach called Open Development.  The primary principle of the Open Development initiative is Open Data and Knowledge, Open Operations and Tools and open solutions. The Bank facilitates all interested parties with accessible, easy-to-use data, and with unprecedented access to other information and documents.  Broad access to these data allows citizens, CSOs, policy makers, advocacy groups and other stakeholders to make better-informed decisions and to measure improvements more accurately.


 
 
 
The World Bank’s Access to Information (AI) Policy represents a fundamental shift in the Bank’s approach to making information publicly available. It recognizes the centrality of transparency and accountability to the development process and includes principled commitments to strengthen public ownership and oversight of Bank-financed operations. The Bank’s Open Data, Open Finances, Geomapping, Open Knowledge Repository (OKR) and other platforms and open tools, Mobile apps represent its efforts to foster transparency and openness.


 
 
 
This workshop has thus been planned to raise awareness and ensure that average citizens and beneficiary communities learn to use the policy and open tools to access timely and relevant information and data on Bank-financed projects and make the Open Agenda to be better known among academics, researchers, CSOs, and policymakers in country.


 
 
 
Broad Learning Objectives: 
 
 
 
·         Gain appreciation of the  Open Development agenda and linkages between various initiatives.
 
·         Increase awareness on Access to Information (AI), Open Data, Mapping, and other Open Data tools.  
 
·         Be able to use Open Data tools to validate information: compare data across countries or settings
 
·         Know where to go for help and further support

allows tracking of real estate prices in different cities in India. It
is currently restricted to residential housing and there are plans to expand its
scope to commercial property as well.

I however don't find it too useful because the data available is a
relative measure of the price of the property, measured against
a the price at point in the past. The relative measure does allow one
to see the appreciation (or otherwise) trend in real prices in a given
city.
I have been told that NHB does collect the absolute
per square feet prices (from which RESIDEX is derived) but as always
doesnot make those points available on its website.

More available here: http://www.nhb.org.in/Residex/delhires.php

Hope this helps - if you are able to find some more data sources on
the real estate side - I request you to kindly share with the larger
group,

You Can't Just Hack Your Way to Social Change
by Jake Porway  |   1:00 PM March 7, 2013

blogs.hbr.orghttp://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/03/you_cant_just_hack_your_way_to.html
""We have a lot of data, but we have no idea what we should do with it."" The director of the foundation looked plaintively across the table at me. ""We were thinking of having a hackathon, or maybe running an app competition,"" he smiled. His co-workers nodded eagerly. I shuddered.
I have this conversation about once a week. Awash in data, an organization — be it a healthcare nonprofit, a government agency, or a tech company — desperately wants to capitalize on the insights that the ""Big Data"" hype has promised them. Increasingly, they are turning to hackathons — weekend events where coders, data geeks, and designers conspire to build software solutions in just 48 hours — to get new ideas and fill their capacity gap. There's a lot to be said for hackathons: They give the technology community great social opportunities and reward them with money and fame for their solutions, and companies get free access to a community of diligent experts they otherwise wouldn't know how to reach. For all of these upsides, however, hackathons are not ideal for solving big problems like reducing poverty, reforming politics, or improving education and, when they're used to interpret data for social impact, they can be downright dangerous.
At DataKind we run ""DataDives"", weekend events that team nonprofits with pro bono data scientists to solve tough social problems. They are not easy to get right. Data events like these require special requirements beyond your average hackathon. You need to have a clear problem definition, include people who understand the data not just data analysis, and be deeply sensitive with the data you're analyzing.
Any data scientist worth their salary will tell you that you should start with a question, NOT the data. Unfortunately, data hackathons often lack clear problem definitions. Most companies think that if you can just get hackers, pizza, and data together in a room, magic will happen. This is the same as if Habitat for Humanity gathered its volunteers around a pile of wood and said, ""Have at it!"" By the end of the day you'd be left with a half of a sunroom with 14 outlets in it.
Without subject matter experts available to articulate problems in advance, you get results like those from the Reinvent Green Hackathon. Reinvent Green was a city initiative in NYC aimed at having technologists improve sustainability in New York. Winners of this hackathon included an app to help cyclists ""bikepool"" together and a farmer's market inventory app. These apps are great on their own, but they don't solve the city's sustainability problems. They solve the participants' problems because as a young affluent hacker, my problem isn't improving the city's recycling programs, it's finding kale on Saturdays.
To avoid this problem, organizations have to be willing to put time and effort into scoping problems with the technologists ahead of time. Reinvent Green could have invited recycling managers, urban planners, or other experts to converse with the hackers before the event. Organizations also need to be willing to get down-and-dirty with the data geeks during the weekend. It's not enough to just throw the data over the wall and hope for the best.
Subject matter experts are doubly needed to assess the results of the work, especially when you're dealing with sensitive data about human behavior. As data scientists, we are well equipped to explain the ""what"" of data, but rarely should we touch the question of ""why"" on matters we are not experts in. Take for example a finding from the data team at Uber thatprostitution arrests increased on Wednesdays based on Oakland Crime Data. One hypothesis for the uptick was that welfare checks are distributed on Wednesdays, meaning more welfare recipients had money to spend on prostitution. Wild, right? However, one commenter on Uber's site who had worked with the Oakland Police Department pointed out that prostitution arrests occur on quieter nights, so maybe there weren't more prostitution incidents on Wednesdays, just more prostitution arrests. If experts in the data — like arresting police officers — had been involved, this would have been apparent.
Statisticians have long known that data analysis helps us understand our world, but never fully explains it. George Box famously said ""All models are wrong, but some are useful."" What this means is that we must be vigilant in communicating that, while all of this new big data will give us new and wonderful insights into our world, no single result should stand as the ultimate truth.
Take, for example, a project the Grameen Foundation brought to a DataKind event. The Community Knowledge Worker program employs Ugandan workers to provide rural farmers with timely agricultural information via cellphone. Grameen wanted to use the mobile data to evaluate which of their workers in Uganda were ""good"" and which were ""bad"". If you only look at the number of times a worker gives someone information, a certain set of people are identified as good performers. If you instead look at the number of farmers a worker gives information to, a very different set is seen as effective. Which metric is right? Well, both of them. And neither of them. They are merely different perspectives on the same data. Together they form a richer picture of the world for Grameen Foundation, but neither should be considered ""right"".
We live in exciting and promising times. The flood of data we are collecting will yield new and earth-changing insights, some of which will be made by enthusiastic volunteers at hackathons. Let's lay the foundation for their success by bringing together world-class teams to ask the right questions, collaborating on the best interpretations of the data, and striving, always, to be sensitive. Data isn't just a spreadsheet or a database: It's us. It's the people we care about. It's our world. Let's not just hack it.
Please join the conversation and check back for regular updates. Follow the Scaling Social Impact insight center on Twitter@ScalingSocial and give us feedback.

for instance many of you will be aware of the Reinhart-Rogoff paper on growth and debt levels which was recently shown to have serious methodological flaws...however the inference from this has been made that had the paper not made these mistakes, many of the countries in the EU would not have been put through punishing levels of austerity. the assumption here being that policies on austerity were heavily based on this one paper. this is quite naive. in many such cases the political decision has already been taken. the data part of it is just an input.
And its not at all clear that had the data showed something else, a different decision would have been taken

Subject: Data and Stories


Hello all,

Gautam, Meera and I have been talking about bringing media and data
into one positive feedback loop. We are having a small meeting on
April 6th (next Saturday) at NIAS on how we can bring data, models and
stories together.

The idea is to have a few presentations of about 10 minutes each and
then a discussion on how we can build the data-model-story stack as an
ecosystem.

Current plan:

We start at 11:00, and have presentations from 11:00 to noon and then
discussion from noon to 1:00. If there's interest we will do a
hackathon at the end.

Hope all of you can make it - I will also be calling some of you to
give a brief talk.

Also please send this to anyone else who might be

a) Interested
b) Interested in giving a talk
c) Both

cheers,
Rajesh

Gram Panchayat (GP- the smallest rural administrative body) comprisingof one or more revenue villages does not have the boundaries drawn by anyparticular agency (as far as my current knowledge goes) Although RegistrarGeneral of India -Census demarcates the boundaries of Panchayats whenever anew GP is carved out/merged from existing ones.2. Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has now taken up the initiative tostart the exercise of generating GP boundaries from the Revenue Villageboundaries based on the tagging done in an application called LocalGovernment Directory (LGD) accessible at *lgdirectory.gov.in.*In this application, State Panchayati Raj (PR) Departments have startedtagging the respective villages to the respective GPs to which they belongto. Once this exercise is completed, GP boundaries can be extracted veryeasily by merging the village boundaries. (Only in those cases where awhole/full village forms a GP.There are instances where villages get split between 2 or more GPs. In sucha case, there is no easy way out but to manually digitize the boundary ordo a GPS survey and upload the coordinates.3. MoPR will not wait for only the LGD tagging to finish. But it may startwith GPs as point features so that data related to GPs can be tagged on aGIS and necessary GIS based graphical outputs and analysis can be done(without boundaries also, whereever possible) As no much area calculationis supposed to be initiated in the early stages and we definitely can  notexpect 100% data readily available (because this will be the first time inthe history of India that such an exercise on a GP level will be initiated)4. I am not sure about NRDMS (but I am pretty sure that, boundarieswherever available are those of Revenue Villages- made available by Surveyof India- authentic and ready to be used) But I don't think the shape filesare available for download. Moreover the question shouldn't be to get theshapefile:- if you are a developer, get the WMS from NRSC team (incharge ofBhuwan) or from NIC-GIS division, and use the service to project boundarieson your application. We need not think that unless we get a shp file ourproject doesn't start.I will make sure that village boundaries are made available as a WMS andlet me see what can be done to make the process more easy.5. Bhuvan team is coming up with another version called Bhuvan GeoPanchayat (which will have detailed spatial data generated from satelliteimages; i.e. secondary products like land use, land cover, kind of mapsgenerated using image processing and GIS softwares.) There is a projectcalled Space based Information for Decentralized Planning (SIS-DP) underwhich huge number of such data has been generated for a few States on ascale of 1:10,000 and for some on a scale of 1:50,000.All of this will be in public domain just like present bhuvan. And to usethem, you can call them using WMS.There are huge strides being taken in this regard, and I requestcooperation of intellects like all of you to give valuable inputs formaking Geospatial tech available for our villages and GPs.*Summary*:-Gram Panchayat boundaries are being prepared. (since its based on LGDtagging- done by States themselves- it will be made public onceverification is completed as to whatever village names have been tagged toGPs are correct or not.)Taluk/Block Panchayat boundaries- Block boundaries may be/are available notsure about from where you can download the same.For any information or suggestion, please call me any time or best, drop amail. Let us create the tech for our India through maps. Just think of meas yours eyes and ears in the government.

        panchayat boundaries do not exist to my knowledge as of yet
         MoPR is at present looking geting them done but that depends of
        the state government. 
        For that your best luck is with the state government

        I was told by someone in MOPR that West Bengal is the only

I've been tweeting about Vega since last night. It's an amazing way of
making visualizations. Built on top of D3.js, Vega uses JSON to define
the grammar.

Check it out: http://trifacta.github.com/vega/

Quick use-case: if you don't want to do all the heavy data crunching
and also not send the data to the client-side (which often causes the
browsers to crash), do all that on the server and send the JSON to the
client. Vega will beautifully render it in HTML Canvas or SVG.

Cheers,
Sajjad.

If the points in the GPS are a series of lat-longs - you can readily
plot them on a graph-sheet assuming the x axis as longitude and y axis
as latitude (since India is entirely north of the equator and east of
the 0 meridian you can readily use the first quadrant). You can even
use Excel plots and replace the background with an appropriately
aligned image of a map (orthographic projection). Paths can be plotted
with line plots. A small grid region of about 500 sq. km. near the
equator is easily dealt with for a lot of applications with Cartesian
approximation.

Hello, 
Can I get some background on the two events? What are you aiming for?
Could you specify the intended impact of the visual? Helps to identify direction and design, and also the depth one needs to go to get the right kind of information.
I'm based in Mumbai. 
Thanks,

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/internet/Google-Maps-contest-Mapathon-2013-worries-defence-establishment/articleshow/19230122.cms?prtpa
Rajat Pandit, TNN | Mar 27, 2013, 02.40 AM
        IST










The
                        contest 'Mapathon 2013’ organised by Google
                        India to update its internet maps has left the
                        defence establishment worried.








NEW DELHI: The
                Indian security establishment is up in arms over
                'Mapathon 2013', a public competition organised by Google
                  India to
                update its internet maps, holding that such
                ""unauthorized"" endeavours could have serious
                repercussions for national security.

              Sources said the Survey of India,
              the national survey and mapping organisation, has asked
              the ministries of defence, home affairs and science &
              technology to take ""suitable action"" to prevent illegal
              mapping activities like Mapathon 2013 because they are
              ""likely to compromise national security interests"".

              Freely available satellite imagery and mapping facilities
              like Google Earth and Google Maps have often run
              afoul of military establishments around the world, with
              governments many a time getting the service provider to
              blur or blank out images of sensitive sites and
              installations.

              Similar has been the case in India, with the government
              getting some high-resolution satellite images of
              Rashtrapati Bhavan and Parliament, South and North Blocks,
              vital nuclear and military installations masked in the
              past.

              Mapathon, billed as the ""first-ever"" mapping competition
              organized in India by Google Maps from February 12 to
              March 25, is the latest provocation in that continuing
              tug-of-war. A crowd-sourcing initiative, Google promised
              Android tablets, smart-phones and the like to the top
              1,000 mappers who would add details and help improve its
              maps.

              But on behalf of the Surveyor General of India Swarna
              Subba Rao, his deputy major general R C Padhi told the
              three ministries that Mapathon was ""not in accordance with
              the national Mapping Policy 2005 and map restriction
              policies issued by the defence ministry from time to
              time"", sources said.

              Added a senior defence officer, ""Such activities can have
              serious security repercussions in case mapping of
              restricted areas is undertaken by members of the general
              public.""

              But Google pooh-poohed all this. ""Mapathon is a
              user-initiative to map new destinations and areas of
              public interest. It generated a huge response. We mapped
              82,000 restaurants, 42,000 places of worship and 32,000
              health centres and hospitals,"" an executive said.

              ""We have no intent or desire to compromise national
              security. We steer clear of all sensitive installations.
              All our mapping activities follow guidelines and
              applicable laws,"" she added.

              Not all, however, are convinced. BJP MP Tarun Vijay, for
              one, has asked the government to book Google for
              ""violating"" India's defence regulations on maps by
              ""illegally"" inviting people to map the country and send
              data to its US-based servers.

              Others pointed out that countries like the US have banned
              Google from taking pictures and making detailed
              ""street-view"" maps of its military and other important
              sites. ""While we do take steps to protect our airbases and
              other installations from satellite and thermal imagery,
              such activities like the Mapathon need to be regulated,""
              an IAF officer said.

With the recently held Open Data Camp 2013 in Bangalore and the upcoming 
#12thPlan hackathon being organised by Planning Commission et al, the 
time seems right to organise a gathering of data enthusiasts in Delhi.

The DataMeet gatherings started in Bangalore in mid-2011 initially as 
periodic meet-ups, which slowly became a wider loose network of data 
enthusiasts in Bangalore and elsewhere, eventually leading up to Open 
Data Camps and data visualisation workshops.

Please let me invite you to a DataMeet gathering to be held in Sarai, CSDS, Civil Lines, Delhi on Friday, 12th April at 5 pm. Sarai has 
graciously allowed us to use the seminar space for our meeting. See this 
page for address and direction: 
<http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=location>. Let me know if you need any 
further details regrading reaching CSDS or other things.

The purpose of this gathering is to meet fellow (government and non-government)  data enthusiasts in 
Delhi, share challenges and opportunities, and beginning discussions 
around future projects and initiatives.
We hope to have a good mix of researchers, programmers, activists and advocates.Please RSVP so that we have an idea about the number of people gathering.

Ashwin Mahesh
Am
 trying to get hold of some ambient air quality measurement devices to 
track air pollution in the city. I feel if we open up this data, then 
there would be much greater pressure on the pollution control board and 
others to ensure that air quality in the city is of 'livable' standard, 
which I wonder about at present. We've already built the presentation 
and sharing platform for this at Mapunity, the only thing remaining is 
to install the devices in a few places where they can be linked to an 
internet connection. A few ppl around the city have offered to host such
 data points on their connection. That's all we need to do - crowd 
source the data, and demand measurable improvements.My comment on facebook :
Shamala Kittane Subramanyan this
 is super ! but what may also be a good starting point is to get BBMP up
 about all the burning of plastics in the city (crowd sourcing here will
 call for immediate attention)). Its a norm for pourakarmikas to burn 
all the leaf litter and plastics on
 roadsides - we really got to get BBMP to become aware of its ill 
effects and impart the knowledge and awareness to pourakarmikas. I can 
pitch in for this....would really like to get involved in ways to improve 
air quality in the city. Thanks for bringing it up.Please let me know and we'll work on it.
Thanks shamala

In an offline app, would the map tiles be considered as cached content? In that case, no!

1. Devices — phones, tablets, computers — may cache an unlimited amount of map imagery for offline use or to improve performance. You may not proxy or redistribute cached content.
This deals with any of the tiles hosted by map box as their hosting plans varies with the number of tile views. Caching is fine, but not redistributing tiles since you would be bypassing the mapbox service.
 
2. You may derive datasets from MapBox open data sources with proper attribution according to our guidelines. MapBox Maps are owned by MapBox and you may not derive works from them without a license.
Mapbox Maps are those created by Mapbox and may be copyright as they are the tile creators, the data they use however is all open and you can create your own tiles if you so wish . 
What you would want to do for your case is to use tilemill using the data sources that you want to generate your own tile set in the .mbtiles format and either serve it via the web or package it with the app itself.

Considering 200 people registered in total!
I want to especially thank the Sponsors! Akshara, Google, India Water Portal and HasGeek! Without their support there would not have been an ODC at all!And to the volunteers, who came and helped make the day run a little more smoother!
I am editing the video and will be asking for the presentations from speakers.  Presenters if you are on the list please share your presentations!Also we would like to have some feedback from those attended: 
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gDP5Kz6DnKk6GY5JIy2ZUL3UBsG-ygEExUSi26PdNxk/viewform
Again we are still experimenting with these open datacamps. We learned this time around that the workshops were very well attended but the hackathon was sacrificed because we spread ourselves out a little to thin. So we are trying to see what the best balance is. 
But all in all it was a really great two days. Thank you all for making it possible for us to continue sharing! Over the next few weeks we will be posting continuing topics and feedback that people wanted to hear more about, and also ways to really utilize some of the opportunities with Data.gov.in!

Awesome. The code is here: https://github.com/klpdotorg/klpwww/tree/osm
Map specific code is here:

It's JavaScript and not too great. There are few more changes that are

Digitization of PDS Records Digitization of Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) related data, including beneficiary data, is a primary step to be taken by States/Union Territories (UTs) for computerization of TPDS. Digitization of beneficiaries’ database is expected to ensure correct identification of beneficiaries, distribution of TPDS commodities to deserving beneficiaries, elimination of bogus/duplicate ration cards, etc., thereby putting a check on leakages/ diversion of TPDS commodities. In some States, modification/updation of beneficiary data through online software has helped in improving the service delivery and bringing transparency of information. 
Digitization of Ration cards/ Beneficiary database is reported to have been completed in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Daman and Diu, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Punjab, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. It is reported to be in progress in Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim and Tripura.

1. When talking about the RTI and ""open data"", maybe it is worth
talking about the proactive disclosure bit? Me thinks that a case for
open data can be built on that.
2. I don't see a compelling case, rhetoric aside, as to *why* private
organisations should share their data. Personally, I'd like for it to
happen, but I'm wondering if we can build a good case, by example or
logic, as to why sharing data is good - network effect aside.

Address a letter to the officials in your bus company requesting a spreadsheet/database of the stops, routes, areas, etc. in soft copy format. PRINT IT OUT and TAKE IT WITH YOU.2. Go to meet them, be humble and say sir/madam when required, and bring your pen drive if you feel lucky.3.

  As far as i know, BMTC bus information is already added to Google
Transit last year. It has been added BMTC with support with some
agency.
  Once the bus data is provided through Google Transit, the data is
already in GTFS format.
  Go to Google map and try to find a direction in Bangalore it will
provide some bus travel information. The information pretty accurate.
  What it does not provide is the bus timing.  What can be done is to
add more bus route information to it.
  Adding Metro data in GTFS will help provide multi modal transit
information which I think will be quite uesful too.

Suvajit

3225,Suvajit,#topic/datameet/paiEe9og9f4,21,2012-04-20 20:07:00,Re: List of BMTC Bus stops,"Hi All,
As I said earlier, Google just get a feed from the Transport agencies or
 whomsoever entrusted by the agency to provide the data in GTFS format. 
They do not own the distribution rights of the data.Thanks Raghu for the clarification done from Google internal sources.
So we can ask BMTC to make the same data public. If pushed for, BMTC can
 release the data for public. BMTC has no competitor for its business in
 Bangalore. 

But the dataset that is there now is not complete hence not useful. As a
 citizen, I cannot depend on Google Transit information to plan my 
travel in the city using public transport facilities. 
That is where we need to work. We need to prepare a comprehensive data 
set for bus & metro routes, schedules and timings. This data is not 
readily available. I am sure even BMTC does not have this information at
 one place.

If few people in the group is interested/motivated to work on this, we can team up and take it forward.

So you as a user-volunteer-contributor, every time you take a bus journey in Bangalore, input the following details:
1. Source bus stop2. Time at which you reached source bus stop3. Time at which bus reached source bus stop
4. Bus No. 5. Destination bus stop6. Time at which you reached destination bus stop. 
Of course, if we build a smartphone app for this, all except no. 4 are automatic. You only need to enter the bus number you're in while riding. Now, based on all this data, assuming it takes off, we can have a crowdsourced BMTC time table. It will accurately reflect the distribution of the actual time when a bus is going to reach a bus stop, accurate time taken for journeys, with timeofday information, etc. On top of this we can build a ""Bangalore bus planner"" where given a source and destination, and your preference in terms of expected travel time or maximum travel time (and taking into account time of day, etc.) or number of connections, the best possible route will be recommended. 
I just realized anotehr constraint to this - most people who travel regularly by bus won't have smartphones, so we'll need to think of an easy-to-use and reliable SMS based system for people to input their data.

When we started for Chennai, we built the system around the data available in Chennai at that time. Much has changed since then and the project begs to be restarted afresh.What I have in mind for the next version:
* Crowdsource any kind of public transit route data: share autos/, ferries, cycle rickshaw routes apart from the regular buses/trains for any place in India* Sync with openstreetmap data for spatial data: bus stands, stops, bus roads, railway stations, metro..
* Transit planner built on OTP[1]* Generate and host public feeds of collected data in various formats: gtfs feeds, shapefiles, garmin maps, custom transit map tiles etc which can be used by other projects[2]
We built on an open source stack (django/openlayers)[3] and would love to see the project renewed . If anyone is interested, please fork the code and see if you can play around. The challenge at hand is that transit information is complex data and not as simple as a wikipedia article to crowdsource. What kind of interface to have, how will moderation work and how to verify accuracy of the data, what will be the data structures?

Either it is correct or it isn't. One needs to know the official truth to establish a base line against which users can usefully provide feedback. That means you need to get the official data FIRST. Under RTI it is your right to do so.Our experience in Mumbai with the BEST and our project called ChaloBEST has been that the best solution is to source the raw data from officials, and make your own GTFS or APIs or apps around it. And make sure it's updated as per official changes so it is reliable. Approach the agency, bring a letter stating your request, be polite, and make friends with them so you can keep coming back for more.I seriously doubt that anyone can ""crowdsource"" all the required fields for building a valid GTFS feed, unless we have a Nation of Millions.

It is an official data prepared by the operators for their operations.     Moreover, the timetable is just a plan. It is upto the drivers to follow the plan. This planning done today by most of the operators is grossly averaged out and can be sometimes unrealistic.    Hence, none tends to follow the plan.      Crowdsourcing can gather the travel time information which can then be tallied and a realistic timetable can be generated. But that is all together a different problem and can be addressed later.    But what I feel, a brainstorming is needed amongst us on this to take it to action phase.    Can we plan a meet sometime soon ?Regards,SuvajitOn Thursday, April 12, 2012 7:26:19 PM UTC+5:30, Srihari Srinivasan wrote:Hi Folks!Any ideas from where I can get a list of all bus stops in Bangalore?

The final goal is to make a GTFS feed for BMTC, but doubt if anything to the level of unique stop/shelter exists. Bheema/praja.in have done partial work on this already, but I feel its a lot of work and messy to manage on google docs. It would be easier to build this if there is a good starting database and we slowly fill in the missing links using a dedicated frontend.

We still need more people so please if you have extra time sign up for one or more of the following items. 
Also we need photographers and people to take video. If you have a video camera that you don't mind bringing so we can use. Please think about bringing it, so we take video of the sessions and of people'e experiences. 
Friday evening - Wifi set up and run through - we need 1 or 2 more ppl who know how to do this to help.Saturday morning - Wifi set up (if you can't come Friday think about coming Saturday morning)
Registration and set up - We need help putting up signs around the venue and with checking people in. Saturday during the day - Room monitors and people to take videoThere are 5 rooms so we need about 10 volunteers who when they are in a room to monitor the speaker for time, make sure they have no trouble the projector, and also to make sure the video camera is recording. 
Sunday - We have 3 rooms for workshops and they need room monitors as well. So around 6 people for that. Sunday evening - venue cleanup - a few people can stay later and help organize and make sure we leave the place like we found it!
Again, if you have contacted me I will put you on a list and email that out to volunteers later this week. However if you can please volunteer, let me know, and show up early on Saturday by 8am to help!

Can we make a small beginning on this one at the Open Data Camp this weekend? Perhaps we can make it mandatory for each and every speaker at the sessions to make public some data that they possess and which is not in the open domain already? That I think will be in line with the spirit of Open Data, and that way we can spend the Hackathon on Sunday doing more useful things than figuring out how to hack our way through data that hasn't been made public.

3252,Pavan Srinath,#topic/datameet/QLCPcJgLQeg,3,2013-02-25 06:29:00,Re: [datameet] Data release as part of Open Data Camp,"Hey folks,Proceeding on the lines of what Karthik suggested - it would be a really neat idea if we can come up with a voluntary pledge to release data into the public domain, on occasion of the Open Data Camp 2013. 
I'm sure that a majority of us here at Datameet have some amount of data with us that has a ""public"" quality to it - where its utility and public benefit grows leaps and bounds if it's released to the larger public. I'm fully aware that most data sets people possess come with riders - a government agency might have given it to you for personal/institutional use and not for sharing it with the wider public. Or you may not be finished with the data you've collected - and you don't wish to release it until you've extracted a good amount of value. And all this is perfectly fine. 
In the former case and in several other situations, I'll admit that I've been far more comfortable sharing data with individuals I trust than truly releasing it into the public domain - and this is where I disagree with Karthik - I don't think most of us data hoarders in India, we're just far more comfortable sharing it in private. 
However, it will be great if all of us can take a look at what data we have and see how much we can put out into the open without too much trouble. Data has a strong network quality to it - the more data sets you have, the more value one can extract by looking at their relationships. 
Now, we can do this in three ways:1) We announce what we're willing to share here on this email thread. (I can go first!)2) We share our intentions with our gracious organisers Thej/Nisha and we go with the public release at the Data Camp for greater effect.
3) Some of you might even want to share the data anonymously, and we might need an intermediary (like what Thej does with the wonderful http://openbangalore.org/)
Let me know what you all think.Regards,Pavan--Pavan Srinath

How about having a shared folder on the local network at the Camp.
People can upload/download from it anonymously (that is in case they
dont want share details. Uploaders can include a contactme.txt if they
want)

Later we can share it online. Probably Anand will help us to upload it
to Archive.Org.

- Weather station monthly rainfall, 1901-2000
- Daily rainfall data for 1951-2007 extracted from the Aphrodite gridded data set- Cleaned up hourly weather data for 2012 from IMD's automated weather station for the city. (With due credit to Anand C's invaluable archiving and his effort along with Asok at creating a CSV dump)
- Daily rainfall data from multiple sources in & around the city over the past 3-4 years.Rainfall and climate data on Wayanad:- Daily rainfall data for Muttil, Wayanad - 1983-2010 (has gone offline - will put it back on)
- Monthly weather parameters from Ambalavayal Agro Research Station, Wayanad - 2000-2010- Monthly rainfall data from Chundale Coffee Research Station, Wayanad - 1970s-2010- Monthly rainfall data collected by CGWB from ~ 20 private sources across Wayanad for 2000-2005.

http://zzolo.org/thoughts/what-hackathons-really-are
With a big weekend of civic code-a-thons around the world, here are some useful insights from the co-founder of Open Twin Cities - http://opentwincities.org - and former Code for America Fellow Alan Palazzolo.
For the non-coding ""democracy and community builders"" among us we know ""we want some of this"" in our local regions, but it isn't always clear how we can help. Clearly having a community organizing tech people as the instigators are key, but what if those hub persons haven't hooked up with the civic coding movement? Passing on Alan's article and the links below to the right people might be a first step toward inspiring someone to be that leader for your community.
Check out:
http://opendataday.org
http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/codeacross 
For those outside the tech world where ""hacking"" sounds like something illegal, just think coding.
Steven Clift
P.S. In couple of hackathon events I organized for next generation BeNeighbors.org explorations (dynamic proximity connecting online), Alan's comments about community building and I might add belonging to a cause bigger than their day job coding for the man resonate with me. I went in expecting coding and my beer and pizza supply bought me brainstorming and lots of social community building. :-) I think a big win is when someone with the right leadership and coding skills is inspired by the hackathon to follow through after the event and to make something happen over the long run.

Join the online discussion, as we consider current OA policies and make suggestions towards progressive OA policy formulation.

The online discussion is hosted on the WSIS Knowledge Communities platform here [http://www.wsis-community.org/pg/forum/topic/685117/is-the-open-access-oa-agenda-addressing-the-challenges-of-developingworld-academia/].  The discussion is public but in order to contribute, please note that you will have to register on the platform.

Without taking names. I recently read a report online based on a survey. Now, I thought there were some different ways to look at and analyze the survey data, so I wanted to get my hands on the raw data. 
1. Nothing on the website mentioned how one can get their hands on the raw data.2. I asked a friend who I thought might know someone in the organization who did the survey. Friend put through an introduction. Organization sends me an elaborate form which I've to fill along with a research proposal before they deem me worthy of having access to their data. 
3. This is not a for-profit organization. 4. Some colleagues have tried to get data from the same organization in the past, and have been given less data than they asked for because the organization did not deem it necessary (based on the research proposal) to part with more data.

But take names no? :)

I stopped responding to surveys from Moneylife (although I respect
Debashis very much) because they seem to have a predisposition and
sometimes the questions are worded to elicit answers appropriately.
However I haven't asked them for the full data ever, and I assume that
this data. regardless of their non-profit-ness, isn't open.

If there is to be a single point agenda for any knowledge related organization, it would certainly be to seek change in the clause related to work of government so as to be along the lines of 17 USC 105 - a useful discussion on it can be found at http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105

However such proposals were rejected and they didnt go through. 
It is worth taking a look at the copyright act to see how govt works/govt funded works are treated, and you'll find that fairly interesting.copyright in govt works: 60 years
section 52 of copyright act- ""certain acts not to be infringement of copyright""  (emphasis added):(q) the reproduction or publication of-
(i) any matter which has been published in any Official Gazette except an Act of a Legislature;
(ii) any Act of a Legislature subject to the condition that such Act is reproduced or published togetherwith any commentary thereon or any other original matter;
(iii) the report of any committee, commission, council, board or other like body appointed by theGovernment if such report has been laid on the Table of the Legislature, unless the reproduction or
publication of such report is prohibited by the Government;(iv) any judgement or order of a court, tribunal or other judicial authority, unless the reproduction or
publication of such judgment or order is prohibited by the court, the tribunal or other judicial authority,as the case may be;(r) the production or publication of a translation in any Indian language of an Act of a Legislature and
of any rules or orders made thereunder-(i) if no translation of such Act or rules or orders in that language has previously been produced or
published by the Government; or(ii) where a translation of such Act or rules or orders in that language has been produced orpublished by the Government, if the translation is not available for sale to the public:
Provided that such translation contains a statement at a prominent place to the effect that thetranslation has not been authorised or accepted as authentic by the Government;
If you carefully go through the law excerpted above, and pay particular attention to the exceptions there, you'll come to a set of what can only be called 'interesting' conclusions... :-)
for instance if i were to take a copy of a govt act and put it up on a website of mine, without any value added from my side, that's technically a violation of copyright.A

3289,Kiran Jonnalagadda,#topic/datameet/y1BzDvq3FLE,1,2013-02-17 13:00:00,Meta Refresh 2013,"Hi all,If you haven't heard about it yet, Meta Refresh is this weekend in Bangalore.http://metarefresh.in/2013/
Meta Refresh is HasGeek's annual conference on what it takes to build great websites.Like all HasGeek events, Meta Refresh had an open submission process. When we opened submissions in December, we had a simple criteria: anyone who's speaking had to be an authority on the topic. We closed submissions at the end of January and finally, after much deliberation, we've closed the selections and made the schedule.
Look at who's speaking:* Vincent Hardy, editor of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) specification at the W3C* Benjamin Arthur Lupton, author of History.js, the library that makes rich client apps possible
* Zeno Crivelli, author of one of the first HTML5 video frameworks* Our own Akash Mahajan, coordinator of India's largest community of security professionals* And eleven others...
We've got speakers from the US, from Australia, from Russia, from Switzerland, and from India, and precisely zero are sponsored sessions. An event like this is possible only because of the support of passionate individuals like you. There will not be another event like this in India this year, so if you have any interest in web design or front-end engineering, you should be at Meta Refresh. Regular price tickets are available for another day.

3290,bawaza...@gmail.com,#topic/datameet/_drCaEy8OJw,1,2013-02-15 11:08:00,Meta Refresh 2013,"Steve Jobs had famously remarked that design is not merely about appearance. Design is about how things work. This statement is extremely important in the context of web design where designers and front-end engineers must not only focus on the aesthetics of websites, but also on aspects such as usability, performance, cross-browser compatibility and adherence to web standards. The balance between appearance and behaviour enhances the experience of the web interface for different kinds of users. 
At the same time, the front-end technology landscape is constantly shifting. Design and engineering professionals have to continuously learn and unlearn old and new skills, tools and paradigms in order to build outstanding yet seamless user interfaces.
HasGeek presents Meta Refresh, an annual conference on front-end engineering and design. Meta Refresh 2013 will expose participants to some of the cutting-edge technology solutions and best practices that have emerged in the last one year. The conference features talks on web standards, front-end tools, mobility and accessibility, HTML5 video and graphics, and responsive design for making websites usable on a variety of form factors from desktop to mobile. Meta Refresh 2013 also brings together practitioners who will share their experiences and the processes they follow while designing and building products for the Internet.
Highlights of Meta Refresh 2013:

Talk by Vincent Hardy – member of the W3C committee on Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) – on the quest for the graphical web;
Swiss entrepreneur Zeno Crivelli of Jilion will speak about Sublime Video and how it has become a platform for HTML5 video;
Benjamin Lupton – author of DocPad and History.js – will share his experiences on how designers and front-end engineers can cope with a constantly shifting technology landscape;
Participants will have the opportunity to interact with communities such as Bangalore Front-End Designers, BangaloreJS and Design Day at Meta Refresh;
Speakers from Opera, Yandex, Adobe, Miranj, PayPal and other small and large companies will talk about important aspects of front-end development and design.
Meta Refresh 2013 is an event for web designers (who do not have a programming background), front-end developers, product managers, web developers and user experience designers.
Dates: 22nd and 23rd February, 2013
Venue: MLR Convention Centre, J P Nagar, Bangalore

The presentation went well. We went through our concerns and how data.gov.in is implementing the NDSAP. They were positive about several of these aspects and also were aware of some of the issues. While a policy change is somewhat unlikely, we were told that in the implementation guidelines our suggestions can be incorporated. 
Detailed notes about the conversation will be following shortly. They also stated that now they need communities like ours to work on creating apps and visualizations with this data so that they have good examples to show to Ministries when they question why should they share data. We said we would work with them on requesting data, sharing it, and also on hackathons and projects to showcase what can be done with open data.  They will be coming to Open DataCamp and participating in the hackathon on the 2nd day. 
It was a positive meeting overall and the first of many interactions. I feel that if we continue to meet with their team whenever there is an opportunity then we can get some real movement and also more valuable data. 
So let's use this thread to look at data.gov.in and see what else from an implementation side can be done.  Also the biggest ask they had was for us to spend some time and use the platform to request data.< http://data.gov.in/suggest_dataset>  This is so they can demonstrate demand for this data. 
Again detailed notes will be coming soon. Nisha-- Nisha ThompsonMobile: 962-061-2245

3296,Laina,#topic/datameet/BCg9zM5dgxE,1,2013-02-07 21:59:00,Data.gov.in and India Post,"I was collating and categorizing the requests for India Post Data from the data.gov.in website 'Suggestions' section and where possible, providing examples of how this data has been used across the world. 
Additionally, I was thinking of use-cases for the 3 datasets that the department has already made open - namely those related to Philately and Speed Posts. Thejesh and others who are interested in post-offices, I was wondering if you have any thoughts on these?
Requests for data from data.gov.in1.     
Geo-referenced Post Office locations: –
Currently, the India Post website provides an option to search for a post
office by state, district, pincode or office-name. It would be helpful to provide geo-referenced
search results, which can help users locate the nearest
post-office. For e.g, the State of Oklahama’s Open Data Portal provides a map of all
post-offices.  
This service can be further enhanced by providing the Opening and Closing Time
of the Post Office and the various services it provides. Additionally, adding
the date of establishment of the post office would help in correlating
development indicators and rise of communication network in the country, thus
making the case for Post Offices stronger. To cite, a developer in the US has
used similar data to map the spread of post offices across the country. The
video can be found here. 
2.     
Geo referenced Post Box locations: Currently,
there is no information on the location of post-boxes across the country. This
proves inconvenient to users of post-boxes who have to search for them in obscure
locations. Currently, such data is being crowd-sourced by two different
developers in India - http://code.thejeshgn.com/kannu and https://keralapostbox.crowdmap.com/. An
international example is http://wherepost.ca/. However,
if this data is already available with the India Post Department, it would help
to make it open. 
3.      Pincode
Boundary Maps: Currently, a user cannot find the area that a Pincode covers. A
regularly updated boundary map of pincodes in any of the Open Data formats
(e.g. KML, GPX, GML, GeoJSON) would be helpful for identifying pincodes based
on address. Such data can also lead to various interesting applications such as
“Popular places based on pincode” (requested by a user on data.gov.in)Datasets made open by India Post on data.gov.in
4.       Speed Post Data: Currently,
the India Post Department has made one dataset open on data.gov.in regarding Speed Post
services in India. This has details of prices for sending a document /
merchandise by speed post to various international locations. 
5.      Philately Data: Currently,
the India Post Department has made open two datasets related to philately on data.gov.in.
These are
a. List of Post
Offices having Philatelic Counters - http://www.data.gov.in/dataset/list-post-offices-having-philatelic-counters
b.List of
Philatelic Bureaux - http://www.data.gov.in/dataset/list-philatelic-bureaux
A mobile
application can be created for philately lovers, which overlays the data on
these post offices with the data on the stamps available at these locations. -- Communications & Technology Officer,

It would indeed be really handy if the geo-referenced data can be made open through data.gov.in (although I doubt how fast and easily can they do it). In past, I have seen and used a lot of data on same note while in UK to create map utilities which can come in handy to people. 'Ordinance survey' in UK has made a lot of post code data openly available, to have a better idea of what to expect from an Open Geo-referenced Post code data one might wish to have a look at http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/However, we have limitations with our postal code system, since we just have post codes based on Post offices and not street, area(unlike US, UK system) based so that limits the usage of such data to great extent and limits the applications those can be derived out of it which is sad!"

THE OPEN ACCESS DEBATES PARTNERS





















































The Gray Area blog (Eve Gray)




















Is Open Access the weak link in the open movement?


	Open Access (OA) has become an accepted norm for journal-based research publications around the world, led by countries such as the United Kingdom.  Yet has the process of academic publishing embraced the same levels of openness prevalent in other communities, such as Open Data and Open Educational Resources?

	A criticism levelled against OA is its tendency to face inwards, rather than embracing inclusion from groups beyond academia.   This is not only true of the self-analysis process, but also within the narrow focus on OA in terms of journals versus other - or alternative - platforms and instruments.  Another criticism is the lack of open and critical self-reflection.  And a lack of clear definition – upheld in practice – is yet a further criticism.











It is time to envision a new, contemporary OA agenda? And if so, what would this look like?










	Join the online discussion now as we debate the pitfalls and progress of OA.  The discussion is hosted on the WSIS Knowledge Communities platform here.  The discussion is public but in order to contribute, please note that you will have to register on the platform.

MOD Institute invites you to the 4th 'Talk of the Town' Inter-Act, on Saturday the 2nd February at 6 pm at Auditorium, Visvesvaraya Industrial & Technological Museum.
The critical urban talk Inter-Act challenges the question of future city development in India and Germany. On one hand we see the enormous growth of cities like Bangalore while on the other European cities are struggling to stimulate growth thereby challenging municipalities, planners and even citizens, like never before. Furthermore the increase in the variety of stakeholders, economic pressure along with the complexity of land-use patterns and the internationalisation of the building processes are compounding the issues.
For further details, please see the attached flyer.
The format for critical lecture has a time slot of 30 minutes to highlight title, theses, facts and questions. The talk will start by a thematic input of 5 minutes and 3 crucial questions.
We are honored to have expert speakers from India and Germany to deliver the lectures at the event, with moderator from the journalist community from Bangalore. 
The talk is organised in cooperation with Goethe Institute, Bangalore.
When:  2nd February 2013Where:  Auditorium, Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum (MAP) Bangalore.

Subject: [OTT-GOSLING] Incredible 2011 Census Open Atlas Project (UK): 140, 000 maps in 4 days

http://www.alex-singleton.com/2011-census-open-atlas-project/

This guy took UK Open Data and auto-generated, using R, a PDF atlas for each local authority district. 350 of them!! This is pretty amazing and a great and useful application of Open Government Data.

""Because the data and boundaries are available under an open government licence, and that these data have been usefully placed online as direct downloads (data, boundaries), it makes it  possible to create maps for England and Wales in a highly automated way.

As such, since launch of the Output Area level data I have been busy writing (and then running – around 4 days!) a set of R code that would map every Key Statistics variable for all local authority districts.
The code for doing this is fully reproducible, and I have dropped this on my Rpubs blog.""

So this dude produced 350 atlases, each with ~400 maps each! In 4 days this guy produced 350x400=140,000 maps!

How much $$$, time and people does it take StatsCan to do the same thing? I formerly worked at the National Atlas of Canada (NRCan) working in digital map production, & I find this is pretty amazing!

used during data collection through GPS devices.
GPX can represent waypoints, tracks and routes efficiently. When it
comes to complex geometry like polygon and multi-polygons, GPX is not
preferred. KML can take care of these geometries but I've always found
it difficult to deal with KML as a form of geospatial information
exchange. Plus, KML was introduced to work entirely with Google Earth
and their upward geospatial stack. I'm not quite sure whether we would
want to endorse them.

Shapefiles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefiles) are extremely
efficient and widely used, but ESRI has a handle on them and they can
flip the switch to make it a closed standard any day (hopefully not).
If we are ignoring this, I would highly recommend Shapefiles.

In fact, Riju and I spoke about this briefly yesterday and we think
the Geographic Markup Language
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language) is a good
choice. It was developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium) and is
widely recognised as an information exchange format. The GDAL OGR
(http://www.gdal.org/ogr/) library can help you deal with it in
whatever ways you want. Moving to a web paradigm, I prefer GeoJSON
over anything. http://geojson.org/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON. They are fast, simple. Extended
from JSON. Modern maps libraries can easily store and represent
GeoJSON.

My preference will go like this:
1. Shapefiles
2. Geographic Markup Language
3. GeoJSON
4. KML.

Cheers,
Sajjad.

However, it then also demands the content provider to ensure marking multiple fields (mandatory) like CRS etc.I'd also advocate of publishing the data and creating API for more then one format, and for this I vouch for GeoJSON. Both the formats have their own attributes, on one hand GML provides an extra leverage of linking with addition datasets on the network (since this being XML schema and could easily be transformed or linked with Linked data formats) and create content-rich analysis and application. On the other hand, GeoJSON is a robust format, ready to use and access the meta data types format which prevents unnecessary trails. I do not see a point in publishing a data in a format like Shapefiles which on routine might not serve purpose since the data would then after be again needed to transform into a format which the other programming platforms would find themselves compatible with.Hence, my choice: GML and GeoJSON. (Data in both formats be made available)"

If the data on data.gov.in is meant to be accessible by all, it shouldn't be in a format that only a minority are comfortable using."

This new project provides tools to play with geographical data. It
also works with non-geographical data, except for map visualizations
:).

There are embedded data sources in the project, but you can easily
play with your own data in addition to the available ones. Files
containing data about airports, train stations, countries, ... are
loaded, then you can:

 - performs various types of queries ( find this key, or find keys
with this property)
 - fuzzy searches based on string distance ( find things roughly named
like this)
 - geographical searches ( find things next to this place)
 - get results on a map, or export it as csv data, or as a Python object

This is entirely written in Python. The core part is a Python package,
but there is a command line tool as well!

In memory of Aaron Swartz, Noisebridge will be hosting a hackathon starting
at 7pm on Friday, January 25th and continuing through 7pm on Sunday, January
27th.

Aaron was a hacktivist and friend of many in our community. He helped create
RSS 1.0; contributed to Creative Commons; was an early builder of Reddit,
where he's often acknowledged as a co-founder; created the web.py framework;
and more recently, became a data liberator, first with PACER and then with
scholarly articles from JSTOR, both of which got him into trouble with the
law.  Aaron's Demand Progress project helped stop SOPA, the Stop Online
Piracy Act in the US, which threatened to have far reaching unintended
consequences.

Aaron Swartz committed suicide on January 11, 2013, but his work on making
the world a better place should not die with him.  Please join us for two
days of understanding his work and contributing to keep his memory and
projects alive.

For more information, please see:

The critical urban talk Inter-Act challenges the question of future city development in India and Germany. On one hand we see the enormous growth of cities like Bangalore while on the other European cities are struggling to stimulate growth thereby challenging municipalities, planners and even citizens, like never before. Furthermore the increase in the variety of stakeholders, economic pressure along with the complexity of land-use patterns and the internationalisation of the building processes are compounding the issues.
For further details, please see the attached flyer.
The format for critical lecture has a time slot of 30 minutes to highlight title, theses, facts and questions. The talk will start by a thematic input of 5 minutes and 3 crucial questions.
We are honored to have expert speakers from India and Germany to deliver the lectures at the event, with moderator from the journalist community from Bangalore. 
The talk is organised in cooperation with Goethe Institute, Bangalore.

They are keen to get feedback on the kind of datasets that would be useful to researchers and features that can be implemented on their site.
To give you some context, broadly speaking, this is the kind of data they collect (on the enrollment side)
-Timings - How much time it took to enroll a person, how much time was spent in each stage of the process (and this can be broken up by registrar. So in which state was the average time to enroll the maximum and so on)
- Devices - How many enrollments were done on a particular device, which operator is handling a device and so on. 
- People involved - Data about the registrar, enrollment agency, and the person who did enrollment, how many mistakes were found against a particular person and so on
- Type of errors committed - How many errors were committed by which partner of the UIDAI during the enrollment process
- Geography - Data on enrollment by district and sub-district- Demographics of a person - Data on people enrolled. UIDAI has a policy of not disclosing personally identifiable information. However, you can send in suggestions if you think that there's aggregated data which would be useful for researchers
- Internal quality checking - There are a number of quality checks that are done by the UIDAI of people, devices and processes. Is there any information there that you think you can use?
I would be talking to UIDAI in a day or two. Once they get our suggestions, they will see which of the features can be implemented, and which datasets can be made open. 
Since a lot of people here are interested in data, your suggestions would be valuable. Please do send it in by end of day today so I can collate it.

Greetings and wishes on the meeting you propose to have. interesting to see UIDAI go public. some pointers of interest to me:
1. the question is who will be latching on to the data that is expected to be shared, generated out of public funds (read tax payers money). we cannot control the use of data once it goes public. what filters woudl they be applying to access and use of data
2. what is the use of one time data that UID is generating at the scale it is being done?
3. what is the rationale behind the data streams generated? it is important to understand the context in which data was generated. which ones in their perspective have low reliability levels?
4. how good is their data? what kind of statistical validity does it subscribe to?
5. what drives them to put private data (however insignificant it might seem) in the public domain?
6. does their database cover urban areas also ( my current work deals with this?)
 
PS: we met at the ofkn organised meet at nipfp campus near munirka.
 
let's keep talking on this. there are many inititives that could benefit from this interestign database? 
 
it will good to hear their side of the story on these small insignificant points.hope this helps.
warm regards,
Sreenivas

3332,Laina,#topic/datameet/yU2pKONHJGg,3,2013-01-29 17:44:00,Re: [datameet] Aadhaar and Open Data,"Thank you Sreenivas, these are very interesting questions and I will try and answer some of them based on the presentation they made. 1. That is the answer they are seeking - as to who will latch on to their data. As of now, they use this data internally - they have a business analytics team which looks at all the datasets to detect patterns and tweak their process. However, they are unable to see (and are willing to learn) how people outside of UIDAI might find this data useful. 
As to the filters they apply, I don't know the specific filters they apply, but one of the principles on which they build their datasets is privacy - they will not reveal personally identifiable information. So as an outsider to UIDAI, you might get information at an aggregate level, but not anything more granular than that. 
2. UIDAI is building 3 portals - a Direct Cash Transfers portal, an Enrollment portal (which is what I have sent the link to) and an Authentication portal. -Direct Cash Transfers portal would most probably be under the Ministry of Finance, and they will decide if it's going to be open or not. 
-The Auth portal has not yet been built - they are working on it, and I *think it will be open. This portal would give data on usage of Aadhaar numbers by various departments. And by its very nature, it is a continuously updated portal. For example, if the PDS chooses to use Aadhaar numbers for delivering rations, then the auth portal will show you how many people (of the ones who chose to take an Aadhaar number if it's optional or if the department makes it compulsory then how many people) in a particular district used the aadhaar number to access these services. Details about what they bought using the Aadhaar number will not be shared with the UIDAI and consequently won't be available on the Auth portal.
-That leaves the enrollment portal - the way enrollment works is that a person enrolls and 10 years down the line, they have to update their biometrics. So it's not entirely static data. Also, in addition to the aadhaar numbers, there's a lot of other data that's being generated which is more dynamic like the device data etc
3. As Nisha was pointing out in a back-channel message, we should invite UIDAI to the datacamp, and I think they are also very open to explaining their processes to people. That will help you understand the context in which each dataset is created. I don't know about the low reliability levels. 
4. And neither do I know about the statistical validity5. Well, this is a question I can only guess at and I don't want to take wild guesses :)
6. I think it does - data is available at a sub-district level for all states and I *think it is both for rural and urban areas. Can confirmPlease keep the questions coming! I will try and answer based on the presentation they made on 23rd. And if not, I will pass it on.

            ? XLS, XLSX ( spread sheet- Excel)             ? XML (Extensive Markup Language)             ?  RDF (Resources Description Framework)             ?  KML (Keyhole Markup Language used for Maps) 

            ?  GML (Geography Markup Language)             ?  RSS/ATOM (Fast changing data e.g. hourly/daily)             Tim Berners-Lee had classified data into single star to five star categories based on  

            formats for data. Please refer to Annexure II. 2. Would anyone have an idea whether / when state government / local body data will be available at data.gov.in? And whether any departments have published their list of negative datasets?


2.8      Negative      List  –    Non-sharable       data    as   declared     by   the   departments/ organizations 

2.9      Restricted Data –Data which are accessible only through a prescribed process of registration and authorization by respective departments / organizations. 
2.10     Sensitive      Data–   Sensitive   data   as   defined   in   various   Acts   and   rules   of   the Government of India.

3342,sumandro,#topic/datameet/nOsHRD48-co,1,2013-01-23 07:50:00,Is Open Access still relevant? | invitation to a discussion,"Is Open Access still relevant?The last years have been both satisfying and challenging for the Open Access community worldwide. On one hand, we have experienced numerous 'victories' of the OA agenda, such as the OA policy of Research Council UK, the Finch Committee report, and the OA policy of World Bank. Various agreeable arguments have been made forcefully to highlight the need for a transition to OA models of publication -- from betterment of academic practices, to economic growth to human development. On the other hand, the OA agenda seems like only one, and not a major one at that, 'openness' movement among a crowd of similarly prefixed movements. Further, the OA agenda increasingly appears to be a rather limited, rigid, and old one. Many other 'openness' movements such as Open Data and Open Educational Resources, one may argue, are more effectively designed to better academic practices, drive economic growth and influence human development.
In a powerful critique of the existing OA agenda, Peter Murray-Rust asks: 'Is ""Open Access"" the same sort of beast [as the modern ideology and practice of ""Open""]?' <http://blog.okfn.org/2012/10/26/is-open-access-open/>. He goes on to list out the features of this 'modern ideology and practice of ""Open""': meritocracy, universality of participation, a willingness to listen, openness of process, openness of results, and a mechanism to change current practices (please see his blog post for clarification of these features). Instead of having 'open' self-reflections about the changing context and the need for revised strategies, as Eve Gray explains, the OA agenda has often remained haunted by the Budapest Open Access Initiative past and failed to interact with emerging allies such as OA scholarly publications and grey literatures.
To ask the looming question bluntly, is there a need to envision a new, more contemporary if nothing else, version of the OA agenda?In the face of increasing acceptance of OA for journal-based research publications by national and super-national bodies, what are the next frontiers of the OA agenda? Does the journal-centric strategy of the existing OA agenda needs revisiting? The last question is especially pertinent in the context of developing countries, where policy-making is often influenced by privately-funded research. Access to such documents (and their underlying datasets) are significant in such cases for ensuring government accountability, or simply to induce a broad, informed discussion regarding making of national policies. At the same time, the diversity of national policy frameworks across the world poses a critical challenge to any global movement that aims to address global concerns while engaging with local specificities and demands. Similarly for OA agenda, it is crucial to discuss the possibility of a more participatory, flexible and open process of setting strategic agendas at national and regional scales. In this context, it might be useful to revisit the BOAI definition of OA, and question whether this definition is sufficient for a global OA agenda, and also whether the existing OA models (such as Gold and Green OA) are sufficient for delivering the promise of that definition.
To return to the context of various 'openness' movements unfolding worldwide, one may ask, if the OA agenda is now best pursued by dissolving it within other 'openness' movements? Should we talk more of an alliance between various 'openness' movements, or an expansion of some to incorporate the others?

Let me know. I am interested in liberating it.I've been downloading weather data from from www.imdaws.com since beginning of 2012. I'm not sure if it has everything that the weather app is providing, but it has ARG, AWS and RADIATION data for every station every hour.
Here is the data for y'day.http://anandology.com/tmp/data/www.imdaws.com/ARG-2013-01-17.html
http://anandology.com/tmp/data/www.imdaws.com/AWS-2013-01-17.htmlhttp://anandology.com/tmp/data/www.imdaws.com/RADIATION-2013-01-17.html
I've been downloading and archiving the HTML files with the data put in a big HTML table. It would be useful to parse it and publish.The archives of 2012 are available at:

It's for a full host of about 500 stations - so you know that it's original station data and not an artefact of interpolation or any such thing. Also, thanks to Anand we now a full year of hourly data (2012) for all stations - which can act as a great reference when we go forward with 2013. 
Do let me know if you guys end up choosing this. I'm not in town for the hacknight - but I've been manually playing with this data for Bangalore (primary source of data for blog.knowyourclimate.org )and have an idea about the kind of data errors that exist that need correction, and what useful parameters can be culled out at the end of it. I'll be happy to share what I have.

Institutions and researchers have worked together for years on streamlining and improving campus processes to sustain institutional research at all levels. The challenges have been and are many. The new EDUCAUSE ACTI Data Management Working Group (ACTI-DM) white paper, Developing an Institutional Research Data Management Plan Service, provides guidance on developing research data management planning services at higher education institutions, based on a broad sampling of trends in these services at institutions across the U.S. and internationally.
This white paper includes three key sections:


What Should be Included in the Data Management Plan (DMP)

Developing a DMP Service at Your Institution

Skill Sets Required for a DMP Consulting ServiceProviding a DMP service is but one component of a much larger, more formalized process to develop and maintain a research data management infrastructure. An upcoming ACTI-DM paper will address critical areas such as technical infrastructure, governance, and policy of the research institution. In addition, a glossary of data management terms is expected shortly.

3358,Nisha,#topic/datameet/0HP-coeHpCA,1,2013-01-13 23:19:00,Consolidating Data Sheets any recommendations?,"Hi everyone,
At India Water Portal, my colleagues Ragini, Bala and I are working on a data project with Keystone Foundation in the Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu. (Where Bala works) Keystone's programs are focused on the intersection of livelihoods, enterprise, and environmental conservation, and it works mostly with the indigenous tribal population in the area. 

THE DATA
There are several different kinds of data. The major categories are weather (humidity, temperature, rainfall, wet days), water quality, sediment rate, land use, and community water supply/systems. Each of these has a location (a village, a station, or a region), and most also have a date range. The data that is easily correlated (i.e. data from the same time period and the same location) is often in different Excel sheets. 

We have tried aggregate this data by location by individually going through each sheet and figuring out a) the data type, b) the location, and c) the date range. I've also aggregated some of the water quality data (from the DFiD study and the every-other-month data, May 2005-Dec 2008, from the Sigur water project) into one Excel sheet.

Almost all the data is in Excel sheets, but there may be some additional data buried in Word documents. Data is missing in some places and the parameters change over time, especially during longer date ranges.

THE PROBLEM
How do we label, tag, and/or compile this data into a usable format? Right now, the data is in different formats, with different headings, misspellings, and inconsistent formatting. Google Refine can help with some of these tasks, but the general problem is larger: there are many variables and parameters, so what is the best way to organize all of this information? We'd like to have a robust but simple-to-use system that can handle complex queries in a way that is easy to understand for laypeople. We're unclear on what exactly can be done with this data, and organizing it properly will go a long way towards helping us conceptualize possibilities.
Any tools that you guys know about that could help us out with this?Nisha-- Nisha ThompsonMobile: 962-061-2245

You can try to identify appropriate ontology (.owl) and use them to tag/label the fields. Having a look onto the excel sheets provided by Ragini, it seems that the data is much sorted and has the potential of getting distinctly classified using ontology. RDF format prevents you from making expenses on proprietary relational databases (just in case if you dont need one!)""We'd like to have a robust but simple-to-use system that can handle complex queries in a way that is easy to understand for laypeople.""On top of RDF data you can create a SPARQL query engine,which will perform queries for specified data fields.

It is tragic how he was treated for making information, that belongs to the public, open. He was a hero to lot of us. I'm very sad to not have his ever present passion and heart no longer around.

Aaron had joined ThoughtWorks about a year back. He was leading a social impact project that provides any individual the ability to write a petition or raise awareness, by finding and communicating with interested masses. It will be Open Source and is targeted toward those in the Global South countries and other areas without much support for the power of the individual voice. In addition, Aaron played a key role in making our New York office a center for activities in the developer community and the political activism community beyond TW.
I've personally been following him since his post-reddit days through his efforts such as Open Library and theinfo.org. I was kind of over excited when I learnt that he had joined us. Also felt very proud as a ThoughtWorker when TW stood against his persecution.
The whole community at TW is deeply mourning his loss. I really wish he had known the support he had from around the world!Will leave you with a beautiful quote of his that will keep ringing in my head -

FBI tried unsuccessfully to nail him down when he downloaded and make public the large collection of PACER documents. He managed get out easily because govt. data is in public domain in the US. I guess they were just looking for another chance.

Since the last time I posted a couple of interventions on the datameet google group, several months ago, Hyderabad Urban Lab, an initiative in collaborative urban research has made slow but steady progress. We have built an online platform for research, data sharing and data generation customised for Hyderabad city (http://www.hyderabadurbanlab.com/maps/). Two of our prime focus areas are water and waste. But along the way, we have been making forays into other areas. One of them is the manner in which the police maintain crime records and share or do not share them with the public. In part, this foray was spurred by the debates around violence against women and the creation of safe and inclusive cities. We believe that by mid March we will have useful insights into crime data management practices and possible strategies for creation of data related to crime in the public domain towards making cities safer. 
We propose to present these insights at the datameet workshop either in a thematic session or in an open session. Please let us know what you think.

Google Maps and other commercial service providers update it occasionally. The frequency of update usually depends on the area and availability of recent satellite images. Updates are frequent if it's a metro. 
At OSM it is voluntarily updated. If one of us spot a change we'll incorporate it.

Viewpoints: Stanford University professor Jeremy Weinstein and Princeton
University professor Joshua Goldstein, write an article<
http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/discourse/60-3.pdf>, ""The Benefits of a
Big Tent: Opening Up Government in Developing Countries,"" as a reply to
Harlan Yu and David Robinson's The New Ambiguity of ""Open Government.""<
http://www.uclalawreview.org/?p=3663>

The abstract says
Bringing open data and open government under a single banner, Yu and
Robinson argue, leads to conceptual muddling that ultimately impedes
progress for both projects. They express a concern that superficial
commitments to open data ""can placate the public's appetite for
transparency."" Drawing on our experiences with the Kenya Open Data
Initiative and the Open Government Partnership, we argue that this need not be the case for three reasons. First, a commitment to open data involves reorienting the production of information in a public bureaucracy in ways that have the potential to institutionalize a commitment to openness.


Second, an open data campaign can accelerate demand for information and generate a public conversation about what kind of data matter for accountability. Finally, the two movements may be stronger together. The open data movement helps open government advocates focus on the end user's needs and the possibilities of new technologies, while open government campaigners challenge open data advocates to focus on how transparency and technology can be leveraged for civic accountability. While it is too early to tell how these movements will play out, we believe that bringing these movements under the same big tent, coherently aligning their strategies, goals, and priorities, might ultimately be helpful for citizens interested in promoting openness in their own countries.

As well as move some of the activity that is not fit for a discussion forum. 
So there are a few suggestions from people. One a place on the site where people can load data projects they are working on and ask for help from people in the group, when people have some time to help some then they can look on the site and volunteer time. 
I like this idea but realized that we need some help from the group to build out the website. Do one or two people have about 10 hours a month to help Thej and me add some functionality and content to the site? If you do please message me off group and we can discuss it.

There are a lot of community functions on the site. As a data-centric community we really should be finding ways to give feedback and demand datasets. I would like share the following google doc with the list of data sets we have been requesting. I will be officially requesting the government related ones on the request data forum. 
We also have priority data we would like Pincodes being the biggest demand and shapefiles being the next more asked for dataset. So please vote for those sets here: Also would anyone be interested in participating in some of their forums. Specifically one about requesting data and discussing formats, standardization, and data quality.
India Water Portal Data ProjectI presented the work I'm doing at India Water Portal The India Water Portal Data Project is looking at water data in India in a systematic way the hopes to see what data is out there, who collects it, what are the gaps, and how you can use data to build quality and sustainable water projects and tell a more realistic story about the state of water in India. 
So we are looking at data from government, NGOs, and academics have to try to get an idea of how to answer two big questions. How much water do we have?How much water do we need?
How much do we have?India's water cycle is constricted to surface water which depends heavily on the three months of monsoon rains, and groundwater. So data around rain, reservoir levels, surface water, and groundwater levels are essential to understand the supply we are working with. This data is scattered, collected by many different agencies, and also is of questionable quality. 
How much do we need?Demand for water is harder to understand. Metering of water use is not widely used and not required by law. Real numbers of actual use are not available but can be deduced from other proxy factors like energy use (for pumps) and what kind of crops are grown. 
The discussion then moved to the urban story of water. How you can check for leaks and get demand information from apt administrators and houses that use tankers. One of the projects discussed was forming a home weather station network.  India Water Portal is in the process of getting a weather station to live stream data in Bangalore. Several people also want to make cheaper versions of a weather station for homes that will also collect data. This network could be a source of data that is more granular and there for more useful for projects like rainwater harvesting. 
If you are interested in working on the Weather network in Bangalore please let me know.  I can connect you to Pavan and Sam Rajkumar. Nisha

We just kinda looked at data in general with an understanding of a shared value that data should be open. Since we're aiming for two days next year we can fit more talks. We can also try to be more balanced and explore what are the strengths and weaknesses of open data. 
I have been flirting around with one major theme and then a few sub themes. These are pretty general but we can narrow them down if they are of interest or throw out your own and we can see from there.  
My Theme Ideas. ""Data is a Starting Point"" - This was a big data year. With things like Data.Gov.In launching and the Census becoming available, as well as, interest in data growing (i.e. Data Camps and Fifth Elephant). What happens once we have data?  Looking at the strengths and weaknesses of data, especially in governance and journalism. How to filter is, identifying high value datasets, enhancing conversations about methodology and formats. etc. 
Sub Theme Ideas""RTI to Open Data"" - How do we bridge the gap between RTI and Open Data, connecting the two in a way that can benefit people in both spaces. 
""Data for Sustainability"" - The sexy term for development is sustainable everything. But what does that mean and how can data help in this end. What projects are really using data well to create sustainable solutions. 
What do you all think? What are some of your ideas for a themes?-- Nisha Thompson

It would be great if there are people/groups focusing on particular types of data. data.gov.in is still in very early phase and we still look forward to more concrete and 'reusable' data.Meanwhile, what I can possibly suggest is look for particular domains and try to generate the data if that is not already available. Like for instance, why not focus on Postcode data. India's postcode structure is still quite bizarre and if some people can try (I am particularly interested) and create logs of postcode with multiple classification levels (tiers) that would eventually over a period of time give a valuable data structure for postcode.RTI and Open Data is perhaps the best avenue for data significance. Ofcourse, this could only be discussed and not be done much since it lies with the government and organizations to release the data, which is accountable for public, in a 'reusable' format and not just release it in plain html or pdf. Would be an interesting issue to take up further!In my opinion, its always good to start of with discussing the opportunities in various avenues on a whole but it would really make an impact if themes are more narrowed down!"

Is Open Access only for rich countries? 


Participate now in an online dialogue on open
access and the developing world 


You are invited to take part in an online discussion on
Open Access (OA) from the perspective of the developing
world.  


Funded by DFID, through the Mobilising Knowledge for
Development (MK4D) programme in the Institute for Development Studies
at Sussex University, and managed through the African Commons project
in South Africa and the Centre for Internet and Society in India, the
discussion will be hosted on UNESCO’s WSIS Open Access Community
Forum. This open access dialogue will provide a valuable space to
discuss different perspectives on what open access means for the
developing world and what it can offer. 

There is compelling evidence which indicates that OA has finally
entered mainstream discourse. Yet, in the developing world context
there remain specific challenges and untapped opportunities for OA. A
series of open access discussions aimed at developing world critical
thinkers, activists and academics, seeks to explore insights and
articulate opinion on OA in the developing world.  Join us for
stimulating debate!

Setting the context 

Open access has enjoyed a great deal of acceptance and growth over the
last decade, with a particularly strong spurt in the adoption of open
access policies by major agencies and governments in the last 12
months. With open access policies and initiatives now being taken up by
UNESCO, the World Bank, the FAO, the European Commission, and the
governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, among others,
it is clear that open access has entered the global mainstream. These
policies stress the human rights potential of open access in providing
access to scientific and cultural knowledge, ensuring its impact and
ensuring public access to publicly funded research. 

We now know that open access can work in the immediate and short term
in providing better access to the research literature, whilst some of
the longer term consequences and effects are still emerging. This is
especially so in the developing world, which has been badly served by
the publishing system we have inherited from the 20th century, which
has marginalized research from developing countries. New opportunities
and possibilities are created by open access, and, at the same time
certain pitfalls need to be noted and avoided.

A foundational report prepared to inform this dialogue shows the risks
posed to all scholarly communications, discourse and practices by the
publish-or-perish system, and indicates that in the developing world,
the detriments are potentially much deeper and more damaging.  As
researchers are incentivised to publish in overseas-based journals -
mostly unavailable in many developing world contexts - this research
‘brain-drain’ risks widening the gap between research and
policy [1].

Get discussing!

The first debate will kick off on
Tuesday, 27 November 2012.

A general topic
will be complemented by two sub discussions.  The discussion will
be hosted on the WSIS Knowledge Platform's Open Access group. To
take part you will be required to register on the platform.

KEY TOPIC: Production, publication and consumption of
scholarly knowledge and OA. 


This will focus on the greater concern of scholarly
research in the developing country context debating the questions: What
does OA imply and offer the developing world in terms of production,
publication and consumption of academic materials and research
activities? What are the specific challenges and opportunities for
access to knowledge in developing
countries?           


Within this topic the following sub-themes will be
introduced: 

Sub-theme 1:
Considering the issues of 'translation' of research for development
impact; co-production and increasing access to academic materials; and
the importance of OA in producing and sharing of non-state-supported
educational materials; and

Sub-theme 2: OA
in academia and the search for global prestige; the perverse impact of
metrics and rankings; scholarly knowledge production; and sharing and
consumption challenges in developing countries.

We will keep you posted about the second debate which will take place
early in January 2013. 


In the meantime you are also encouraged to tweet about
the discussions using hashtag #developoa or follow the debates on

[Bangalore] Dec DataMeet [1 Update]


 [Bangalore] Dec DataMeet

Nisha Thompson <nisha.t...@gmail.com> Nov 18 04:23PM +0530
        
      Hello All,
 
I want to announce the planning stage for the Bangalore Open DataCamp 2013.
Also that we will be having a DataMeet the first week of December.
(Tentative Date Dec 4th, 7pm - Location TBA) Please let me know if that day
and time doesn't work.
 
DataMeet Agenda:
Talk about upcoming Open DataCamp
Events and Updates
Data.Gov.In
Presentation of Project
 
I would like to try to reinstate these meetings and present data projects
that we are all doing. So I will go first and present what India Water
Portal <http://www.indiawaterportal.org/> is doing with data and the state
of data around water in India.
 
I also want to discuss the 2013 Open DataCamp we should begin planning now,
with the hopes of having the event at the end of February.
 
Please use this thread to let me know what thoughts you have around some of
these ideas and if you can make it in Dec.
 
Thanks,
 
Nisha

Hello All,
I am working on the PostBox App. Actual end user application is online
now [ http://openbangalore.org/postbox/ ]. It gets data from Instagram.
Instagram gives me lat, long which are stored as floats in an sqlite DB
[https://bitbucket.org/thejeshgn/postbox/src/tip/db]. Now I haven't used
SQLite for GIS things in the past. So here are my questions.

1. How easy is spatialite and can it work with PHP? I will try n avoid
using it as much as possible.
2. How to get center point given a set of points?
3. How to get nearest points give a point?

Q2 and 3 become difficult if I am not using spatialite. Are there simple
solutions using just sqlite and php?

Let me know.

No knowledge of spatialite but here are some suggestions for questions 2 and 32) by centre you probably mean the barycenter/centre of gravity/average - which would be the point having the x as mean of the x values of the points and the y as mean of the y values of points. This would hold if you use lat - longs and there is no problem with curvature if you are working on India related data (the only tricky points would be around the polar regions). Another measure of a ""centre"" could be the barycenter of the points that lie on the convex hull of the set of points you have.
3) point(s) nearest to a set of points can be implemented based on the amount of data and performance required - for a large set of data the most efficient method would be to have the points in a k-d-tree structure but for a small set you could identify candidate points within a limited bounding rectangle around your search point and then search with actual distances to the reduced set of points in the box. You can search within the candidate points within the  bounding rect rapidly if you have the lat-longs sorted/indexed but the computations of distance dx*dx+dy*dy (can skip the square root since you only need to find the smallest values) will be a bit of a brute force method but could still be within performance requirements for interactions with small data sets.

For eg.one of the areas -- i have been researching the real-estate scene in Bangalore and especially the processes involved and am befuddled with what i see.

I have been using instgram a lot. If you follow me on instagram you would have noticed pictures of postboxes. If you check the details they all have a similar tagging pattern. They all are tagged with #openbangalore #postbox and #pin . The last tag #pin<pin_code> in real will look like #pin560100. All these pictures belong to my secret project called postboxes.
I like sending post cards. It’s such a pain to send post card because its difficult to find a postbox. There aren’t many these days. So for last few months I had been taking geo tagged pictures thinking one day I will clean them up. But that never happened.
But then instagram gave me an option to collect and organize this data in a fun way. I jumped into it. So now I instagram a post box with #openbangalore #postbox and #pin<pin_code>. I also geo tag them. I have a script which uses the instagram API and pulls the image url,Tags, Location, Time, User credits out of it. Cleans up that data and inserts into a SQLite database.
Now I am waiting for the database to build. I am planning to write a web app where you can search for a postbox depending on location or pincode. Of course I will make the DB available at OpenBangalore once we reach minimum data.
Contribute: If you live in Bangalore and use instagram.
1. Please take picture of postbox using instagram2. Tag it with #openbangalore #postbox and #pin where is real pincode3. Geo tag it before submitting
If you are interested in running similar project in your city. You can do that too. Use the following code pull the data. Change the tag #openbangalore to something that makes sense for your city.

Date: 16 October 2012 07:58Subject: [SPICY IP] Internet Fraud: Bogus Open Access JournalsTo: spi...@googlegroups.com



Another ingenious internet fraud is on
the rise – fraud committed in the name of Open Access (“OA”) journals. Unlike subscription-based journals, OA journals are
those which are freely accessible online.  The business model revolves around the
author-pay mode — where researchers pay for publishing their work. [The Hindu
report is available here.]
 



Broadly speaking, the modus operandi
is to send mails to researchers and scientists soliciting manuscripts. They try
to entice researchers by keeping the processing fee low. All bogus journals, as
a rule, promise quick processing time. While many titles do not have editors
listed on the websites, a few others carry the names of respected researchers
from reputed institutions without their consent. In some cases, the titles of bogus
OA journals closely resemble those of genuine ones.  

While there exist genuine OA journals,
there exist a substantial number of bogus OA journals. As the bogus OA journals
lack an honest peer review, they are sometimes used as a platform to publish
low-quality work or manuscripts that have been rejected by genuine publishers.
The issue of bogus journals warrants attention as these bogus OA journals have
the potential to irreparably harm the scholarly literature.



It is difficult to detect the fraud
considering the ever rising number of genuine/non-genuine OA journals and
inexperience of a developing country researcher in scholarly communications. As
there does not exist any organisation or system to check the entry of counterfeits,
the onus is upon the researchers to be vigilant. Those who intend to publish
articles may consider going through Prof. Beall’s blog [here and here] for identifying
bogus journals. Further, I suggest them to read ‘The Hindu’ article.



Information
Technology Act, 2000 and Indian Penal Code, 1860



A
fraud of this nature attracts both Information Technology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”) and Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”) especially considering the ‘long
arm’ nature of both the statutes. Merely accessing a website from a computer
located in India will vest the judicial fora with jurisdiction under the IT Act.
Similarly, any person liable by any Indian law to be tried for an offence
committed beyond India shall be dealt with according to the provisions of IPC
for any act committed beyond India in the same manner as if such act had been
committed within India.



Impersonating
a genuine OA journal constitutes an offence under Section 66C (Punishment for
identity theft) if it is done fraudulently or dishonestly. It can also attract
Section 66D (Punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resource)
of IT Act. As the IT Act has not defined “personation”, the provision is
applicable to a vast array of phishing attacks. Impersonation also attracts
Sections 415 (Cheating) & 416 (Cheating by personation) of IPC. Cheating
under IPC inter alia involves intentionally inducing the person so
deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were
not so deceived and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage
or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property. 



Publication
of a genuine scholarly article in a bogus OA journal may also attract Section
425 (Mischief) of IPC as such publication can destroy or diminish the value of such article. Also, carrying the
names of reputed personalities as members of editorial boards without their
consent can also attract Section 499 (Defamation) of IPC – as it may harm the
reputation of such persons. 



It
may, however, not be possible to tackle all the issues strictly from a legal perspective.
Awareness about the bogus OA journals may offer the best practical solution.
Scholars may be sufficiently warned against publishing their articles in such
bogus OA journals. Further, it will also dissuade academicians who perceive
such journals to be a platform for publication of articles which lack intrinsic value.

Government data portal set for take-off
T. Ramachandran
KOCHI, October 1, 2012


The site is in testing phase now; full-fledged data uploading may begin a 
couple of weeks

Government portal data.gov.in, which will be used to share official data 
with the public, is set to be fully functional soon.

Now in beta or testing phase, the site has technically gone “beyond it,” 
and full-fledged data uploading could begin a couple of weeks after an 
official workshop scheduled for next month, CEO of the National Spatial 
Data Infrastructure R. Siva Kumar told The Hindu.

With this, India joins the rank of a growing number of nations that plan to 
use open data as a tool to promote transparency and efficiency in government.

The National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), which provides 
the framework for official data-sharing, will apply to all “non-classified 
data collected using public funds held by various Ministries/ Departments 
/Subordinate offices.”

The NDSAP is intended to open up public access to such data “through 
established procedures and defined norms.”

An Open Government Partnership launched by the United States and seven 
other governments, and supported by many countries, acknowledges the 
“right” of citizens to seek information on government activities. Though it 
is not part of this initiative, India has collaborated with the U.S. in 
developing the Open Government Platform (OGPL) used for setting up this 
data portal.

The site that harbours the code for the Platform states that it will enable 
governments worldwide to create web and mobile applications to view, use 
and merge various data sets, provide online citizen services through forms, 
registrations and applications, and publish links to regulatory, 
statistical, and other information compiled by government agencies, among 
other things.

The open source architecture of the OGPL, based on content management 
system Drupal, will make it possible for developers to create applications 
fast and make use of the data in different ways.

It is raw data that will be uploaded on the portal, which citizens and 
organisations can put to diverse uses. Most of the data is expected to be 
available free of charge. And, certain categories will not be shared, for 
which negative lists will be drawn up, subject to a periodic review by an 
‘oversight committee.’

A few datasets from certain government departments have already been 
uploaded to the site, which also features some mobile apps.

The government has chosen ‘data controllers’ from different Ministries, 
Departments and organisations to oversee data access and a workshop is 
being conducted for them next month.

Open data activist Nisha Thompson described the launch of the beta site as 
“an incredible first step,” but noted, “The restrictions and limitations in 
its governing policy, the NDSAP, will prevent the creation of a true open 
data site and be a challenge that the growing community of open government 
proponents will have to take up.” She hoped that the government would 
interact with open data groups around the country “in order to really 
understand that this site is something that people want and will use,” and 
that high-value datasets would be made available in due course.

The NDSAP has set the ground rules for sharing government data in both 
human and machine readable forms through the portal. Various government 
departments and organisations are to upload a certain number of datasets on 
the portal, and deadlines have been set for this process.

The portal will list three catalogues — a dataset catalogue featuring 
platform-independent, machine readable data in various file formats and 
other technical information associated with these, including the data 
source. The tools catalogue will include a list of tools available to 
access the data. The apps catalogue will detail the apps available.

The portal also showcases a Developers’ Corner, where agencies, 
organisations, or individuals could share mash-ups created with the data 
sets. Programmers and developers will be encouraged to review the datasets 
and create applications or programmes to add value to the data.

The policy provides for open, registered and restricted access to data. 
While the open category will include a data-sharing process that is “easy, 
timely, user-friendly and web-based without any process of 
registration/authorisation,” data in the registered access category will be 
available only through a process of registration/authorisation by the 
respective Departments/organisations and only to “recognised 
institutions/organisations/public users, through defined procedures.” Data 
categorised as ‘restricted’ will be available only “through authorisation.”

Minister of Water Resources and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Pawan
Kumar Bansal released Atlas for six states viz Kerala, Tamil Nadu,
Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh and Meghalaya in New Delhi
today. Central Ground Water Board has generated enormous data on
various aspects of ground water since its inception; the same has been
compiled and integrated to bring out the publication in the form of
atlas entitled âAquifer systems of India.â
....
The aquifers of India have been classified in to 14 principal and 42
major aquifer systems. The compilation has been done on 1:250,000
scale by integrating the geological and hydro geological data of CGWB
& GSI respectively and various other ground water related the mtic
data/information from other agencies. The Atlas has been prepared
keeping in view the utilities and user friendliness in understanding
by the non-professional as well as professional Hydro geologist.
Simple presentation of tables is used to explain aquifer wise ground
water scenario in the country. Central Ground Water Board Ministry of
Water Resources is contemplating National Aquifer Mapping Programme at
1:50,000 or larger scales during XII and XIII Plan periods. This
ambitions venture will involve compilation and synthesis of all
relevant data collected by CGWB and various other agencies, to
identify existing data gaps, creating of additional data through
suitable investigations and finally, to bring out comprehensive
aquifer maps along with their ground water potential as well as
realistic and scientific management plans to ensure long-term
sustainability.

Hi Jennie,
 
Sorry to miss your session at the Digital Research meeting last week. I hear it went well.
 
I thought you might like to know that, after 6 months without our developer, yesterday we launched our first two sets of unrestricted data to the public at
www.map.ox.ac.uk/explorer.
 
At the moment about 40,000 survey results can be downloaded while another 10,000 are confidential. Our genetic disorder data has already gone online in a less sophisticated format and we are hoping to add two new data types to the explorer
 in the coming year.
 
All the best, Catherine

Subject: [sparc-oaforum] How Open Is It? - Request for Public Comment on Draft DocumentTo: sparc-...@arl.orgNot all Open Access is created equal. To move beyond the seemingly simple question of “Is it Open Access?” PLoS, SPARC and OASPA have collaborated to develop a resource called “HowOpenIsIt?” This resource identifies the core components of open access (OA) and how they are implemented across the spectrum between ""Open Access"" and ""Closed Access"". We recognize there are philosophical disagreements regarding OA and this resource will not resolve those differences. 

 We are seeking input on the accuracy and completeness of how OA is defined in this guide. Download the open review draft and provide feedback below in the comment form on SPARC's website: http://bit.ly/Qi3NVP. In its final form, this guide will provide an easily understandable, comprehensive, and quantifiable resource to help authors make informed decisions on where to publish based on publisher policies.
With this guide we aim to provide greater clarity regarding its definition and components. All suggestions will be considered and a final version will be released during Open Access Week (October 22 -28, 2012). The comment period will close on Monday, October 8, at 5:00pm (EST).

Research  Trends Issue 30: Special Issue on Big Data
Research Trends is proud to present this Special  Issue on the topic of Big Data. Big Data refers to various forms of large  information sets that require special computational platforms in order to be  analyzed. This issue looks at the topic of Big Data from different  perspectives: grants, funding and science policy; data and computational  infrastructure; arts and humanities, and bibliometrics.
Prominent researchers from different institutions  and disciplines have been invited to write about the use of Big Data and  analytics in their work, providing us with examples of tools, platforms and models  of decision making processes. The Special Issue opens with an overview by Gali  Halevi and Henk Moed exploring the evolution of Big Data as a scientific topic  of investigation in an article that frames the topic within the peer reviewed  literature.
We hope you enjoy this Special Issue -- please do share your thoughts 
              and feedback with us!  You can do this in the comments section 
              following each article on our website www.researchtrends.com 
              or send us an email at: researchtrends@elsevier.com.

Apologies for the late posting, OKFestival kept us all pretty busy last week.

Laura and I decided to do one last post, pulling together names of
organisations we met  (or wish we had been able to meet) while on our
trip along with useful information such as Twitter handles.

http://in.okfn.org/2012/09/18/okfn-india-trip-the-roundup/

We'd love to keep building on this list and hope that it is a useful
resource for people to refer to when looking for who to contact in
various areas. Maybe you all already know each other, but from our
experience, it is often quite useful to publish a list so other
organisations can get in contact. If we've missed people - do let us
know, we'll try and feature them in a future update post!

An excellent blogpost. Given I am a newcomer to the field of open
data, and slowly coming to grips with it, your blog has pushed my
learning curve up, substantially.

Its a pity I missed meeting you and Laura, would have loved to talk
about the work we do at Akvo (www.akvo.org) and I am currently based
in Delhi.  If OKFN plans any other trips to India, we will be glad to
be part of your itinerary.

Thanks again for the blogpost. Loved it!

We each refer to this data - on our mobile phones, tablets and laptops - for finding the nearest medical store, for making decisions about property purchases, and for understanding orientation when driving to a new place. Geospatial data is also important for governance and planning, responding to disasters and economic activity such as retail trade.
HasGeek presents Cartonama conference, where you will learn about geospatial data, maps, and applications that are being developed to provide location based services. The conference will feature talks about challenges and best practices of working with location data, building location based platforms from scratch, and GIS based frameworks for real estate analytics.

It's been a month since The Fifth Elephant, but we at HasGeek are not kicking back and relaxing yet. Instead we have a great event lined up for next month!


Cartonama, is a conference on geospatial data, technology, apps and the community around it. The conference is on September 22, 2012 at the MLR Convention Centre, JP Nagar, Bangalore.

	Location data is rapidly becoming necessary infrastructure in many organizations and businesses and this necessitates dialogue on issues such as standards, quality of data, licensing, best practises and community. The conference intends to bring together people working with geo-spatial data, maps and the technologies around them to be a part of such a dialogue.
	
		 

		We are inviting representatives from OSM, Bing, Google Maps, Yahoo! Maps, and cartography organisations and enthusiasts in India and abroad and we'd hear from them on their approaches, philosophies, technology and business models. We will also feature short talks and demos from startups and mid-sized companies which have developed location based services.

Register now for Cartonama, or if you'd like to propose a talk, we're still acceptting submissions until the end of this week, so propose a talk now!

3541,Thejesh GN,#topic/datameet/R7fG_SDhSLA,1,2012-09-15 03:28:00,Introducing Bangalore Open Data Repository,"Hi All,
I have been collecting data about Bangalore for years. The collected data include  Election, weather, GIS etc and were from different sources. I have been wanting to distribute it online for a while. Two big reasons to do it
Unlock the data which was locked up in some govt institutes and make it available to everybody
Help data enthusiasts, data scientists, researchers, journalists and developers who are interested in Bangalore and data.
At last I figured a way to do it. Its through mercurial repository available at Bangalore Open Data Repository. That’s probably the most easiest way to distribute and collaborate. If you are developer you can just clone the project, if not you can download the data dump.
License:The chosen license is ODbL. For those who dont know, its very similar to Creative Commons Share Alike, Attribute license. Its used to keep the modifications or additions to data open as well. A gist of the license below.

You are free:
To Share: To copy, distribute and use the database.To Create: To produce works from the database.To Adapt: To modify, transform and build upon the database.
As long as you:Attribute: You must attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the ODbL. For any use or redistribution of the database, or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the license of the database and keep intact any notices on the original database.
Share-Alike: If you publicly use any adapted version of this database, or works produced from an adapted database, you must also offer that adapted database under the ODbL.Keep open: If you redistribute the database, or an adapted version of it, then you may use technological measures that restrict the work (such as DRM) as long as you also redistribute a version without such measures.
The repository also has code examples to play with the data, convert from one format to other. All code examples are available under BSD license unless until specified.
Contribute:You are more than welcome to contribute to the project. There are mainly four ways to contribute to the project.
The easiest way is to send me the data if you have any. Don’t worry about the format or any other details. Open an email, attach data and click send. If you want it to be confidential then use my GPG keys. I promise not to leak this information to anybody.
Contributing by cleaning up the data. All our data is available in some open format. Download (clone it if u like) it, clean it, use it and send it back to me.If you are a developer you can send the code examples, hacks. Make sure the code is in BSD or similar licensed.
If you are a researcher or visualizer. Go ahead and use the data. It will be great if you can add a link attributing the project and send us a mail. I will list it on our project page.
Please do send me your comments to improve the project. BTW bookmark the link if you havent already

 Institute Index: A Negligent Oil Industry Dumps On Louisiana During Hurricane Isaac

Rajesh Shah <sha...@gmail.com> Sep 11 12:10AM +0530
        
      some good statistics on env damage by oil companies ignoring the storm warning.
 
they have setup a system for people to report environmental spills.
 
wonder what happens in india.
 
also, i followed the links and ended up at skytruth which analyzed oils spills from satellite images, but does not have recent activity.

Institute Index: A Negligent Oil Industry Dumps On Louisiana During Hurricane Isaac
 
September 9, 2012
 
By Sue Sturgis
 
Number of oil industry accidents reported in Louisiana so far in the wake of Hurricane Isaac, according to an analysis by the Louisiana Bucket Brigade: 93
 
Pounds of pollution released in those incidents, a conservative figure given that amounts are self-reported by polluters: 4.9 million
 
Minimum gallons of pollution that were released: 171,000
 
Pounds of sulfur dioxide -- a toxic chemical associated with respiratory problems, preterm births and premature death -- released during the disaster by the Chalmette refinery, a joint operation of Exxon Mobil and Venezuela's national oil company, located just east of New Orleans: 554,000


 
Pounds of other volatile chemicals released in that incident, which was reportedly caused by a hasty shutdown despite ample advance warning of the storm's approach: 10,000
 
Pounds of benzene, a chemical known to cause cancer, that were released: 100
 
Number of accidents reported at that refinery from 2005 through 2012 that involved pollution releases: 491
 
Total number of pounds of toxic chemicals released in those incidents: 6,881,115
 
Pounds of toxic chemicals including cancer-causing benzene and butadiene that the Shell Motiva refinery in Norco, La. reported releasing during Isaac after it failed to keep its flare lit and vented directly to the atmosphere: unknown


 
Date on which St. Charles Parish, where the Shell Motiva refinery is located, issued a mandatory evacuation order: 8/26/2012
 
Date on which Isaac came ashore in Louisiana: 8/28/2012
 
Date on which Shell shut down the refinery without explanation, after keeping it operating at reduced capacity during the storm: 8/30/2012
 
Number of accidents reported at the Shell Motiva refinery from 2005 through 2012 that involved accidental pollution releases: 205
 
Total number of pounds of toxic chemicals released in those incidents: 1,823,421
 
Gallons of oil spilled during Isaac from a storage tank facility owned by Texas Petroleum Investment Co. of Houston and located in the Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Plaquemines Parish, La.: 16,800
 
Amount that company was fined in September 2011 for violating federal spill prevention control regulations at two storage tank facilities in Louisiana, including its Plaquemines Parish operations: $134,895
 
Amount the company was fined in August 2011 for Clean Water Act violations at oil production facilities in Plaquemines and four other Louisiana parishes, and for spilling oil into wetlands: $163,487
 
Year in which the company was sentenced to two years of probation for violating the federal Clean Water Act by negligently causing a spill from its Plaquemines Parish operations: 2009
 
Amount it was ordered to pay in fines and other penalties for that incident: $525,000
 
(Click on figure to go to source. Much of the data and the map are from the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, a grassroots environmental health and justice nonprofit based in New Orleans. For a larger version of the map, which does not show all 93 incidents, click here.)

      Institute Index: A Negligent Oil Industry Dumps On Louisiana
        During Hurricane Isaac
September 9, 2012 
        By Sue Sturgis
         

Number of oil
            industry accidents reported in Louisiana so far in the wake
            of Hurricane Isaac, according to an analysis by the
            Louisiana Bucket Brigade: 93
 
Pounds of pollution released in those
            incidents, a conservative figure given that amounts are
            self-reported by polluters: 4.9 million
 
Minimum gallons of pollution that were
            released: 171,000
 
Pounds of sulfur dioxide -- a toxic
            chemical associated with respiratory problems, preterm
            births and premature death -- released during the disaster
            by the Chalmette refinery, a joint operation of Exxon Mobil
            and Venezuela's national oil company, located just east of
            New Orleans: 554,000
 
Pounds of other volatile chemicals released
            in that incident, which was reportedly caused by a hasty
            shutdown despite ample advance warning of the storm's
            approach: 10,000
 
Pounds of benzene, a chemical known to
            cause cancer, that were released: 100
 
Number of accidents reported at that
            refinery from 2005 through 2012 that involved pollution
            releases: 491
 
Total number of pounds of toxic chemicals
            released in those incidents: 6,881,115
 
Pounds of toxic chemicals including
            cancer-causing benzene and butadiene that the Shell Motiva
            refinery in Norco, La. reported releasing during Isaac after
            it failed to keep its flare lit and vented directly to the
            atmosphere: unknown
 
Date on which St. Charles Parish, where the
            Shell Motiva refinery is located, issued a mandatory
            evacuation order: 8/26/2012
 
Date on which Isaac came ashore in
            Louisiana: 8/28/2012
 
Date on which Shell shut down the refinery
            without explanation, after keeping it operating at reduced
            capacity during the storm: 8/30/2012
 
Number of accidents reported at the Shell
            Motiva refinery from 2005 through 2012 that involved
            accidental pollution releases: 205
 
Total number of pounds of toxic chemicals
            released in those incidents: 1,823,421
 
Gallons of oil spilled during Isaac from a
            storage tank facility owned by Texas Petroleum Investment
            Co. of Houston and located in the Delta National Wildlife
            Refuge in Plaquemines Parish, La.: 16,800
 
Amount that company was fined in September
            2011 for violating federal spill prevention control
            regulations at two storage tank facilities in Louisiana,
            including its Plaquemines Parish operations: $134,895
 
Amount the company was fined in August 2011
            for Clean Water Act violations at oil production facilities
            in Plaquemines and four other Louisiana parishes, and for
            spilling oil into wetlands: $163,487
 
Year in which the company was sentenced to
            two years of probation for violating the federal Clean Water
            Act by negligently causing a spill from its Plaquemines
            Parish operations: 2009
 
Amount it was ordered to pay in fines and
            other penalties for that incident: $525,000

3572,rajesh,#topic/datameet/Xn3es8I3Zz4,1,2012-09-08 01:35:00,So how much land does each Indian REALLY have?,"

    post by Chandra Ravikumar in HasiruUsiru, maybe someone wants to
    create a visualization of this and allow manipulation and mashup of
    data ...

    ----------------------

    Dear All, 
    During the past few years I had begun to wonder just how much land
    for food would each Indian get as his/her share, if the land that is
    India, is apportioned out evenly and equally among every citizen.
    The strain that the growing population - legal and illegal, and the
    criminally stupid policies of the Governments, are asserting on the
    rigidly fixed resource that is Land, and knowing that just a little
    more, and the snapping point will be reached, has been making me
    very uncomfortable and even seriously disturbed. The recent posts of
    Leo on the per capita availability of open spaces prompted me to
    resort to some statistics to answer my initial question. 

    I am posting the results of the little study I did on this. I have
    also given the sources of the information, for verification. I am
    just a simple addition/subtraction mathematician. I have done my
    best, rather I have allowed my calculator to do its best, to get the
    numbers right. If anyone notices a mistake or discrepancy, please
    feel free to correct it for the sake of truth and verity.

    Anyone who is interested in using this information in any other
    place or forum is free to do so. 

    HOW MUCH LAND FOR FOOD DOES EACH CITIZEN OF INDIA REALLY HAVE?

    The Conversion Table:

    1 square kilometer = 100 hectares OR 1hectare = 0.01 square
    kilometers.

    1 hectare = 10000 square meters. 

    1 hectare = 2.41 acres OR 11664.4 square yards OR 104979.6 square
    feet.

    1 acre = 4840 square yards OR 43560 square feet.

    1 meter = 3.28 feet.


    Some Definitions: (From Trading Economics)

    1. The SURFACE AREA of a country is its total area, including areas
    under inland bodies of water and some coastal waterways.

    2. The LAND AREA of a country is its total area, excluding area
    under inland water bodies (major rivers, lakes, coastal waterways),
    national claims to continental shelf and exclusive economic zones.

    3. AGRICULTURAL LAND refers to the share of the land area that is
    arable, under permanent crops, and permanent pastures.

    4. ARABLE LAND refers to (FAO definition) as land under temporary
    crops, (double cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows
    for mowing or pasture, land under market or kitchen garden, and land
    temporarily fallow.

    5. PERMANENT CROPS refers to land placed under cultivation of crops
    that occupy the land for long periods of time and need not be
    replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee, tea, rubber. It
    also includes flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines,
    but excludes trees grown for wood or timber.

    6. PERMANENT PASTURE is land used for 5 or more years for forage
    including natural and cultivated crops. 

    7. FOREST AREA is land under natural or planted stands of trees of
    at least 5 meters in situ, whether productive or not, (? question
    mark is mine) and excludes tree stands in agricultural productive
    systems Eg. Plantation, Agro-forestry systems, and trees in Urban
    Parks and Gardens.


    Statistics for India:

    1. The Surface Area (Geo-geographical area) including area under
    illegal occupation of Pakistan and China = 3287240 sq.kms. 

    2. Area under illegal occupation of Pakistan and China = 120849
    sq.kms.

    3. The Land Area of India  = 2973190 sq.kms.  

    4. The Forest Area in India = 677598 sq. kms.

    5. The Forest Area of India as a % of the Land Area = 22.8%

    6. The Agricultural Land Area of India = 1797080 sq.kms. OR
    179708000 ha.

    7. The Agricultural Land Area in % = 60.4% (I calculated it as
    1795806.7sq.kms.)

    8. The Arable Land Area of India = 1580300 sq.kms. OR  158030000
    hectares

    9. The Arable Land Area in % = 53.2% (I calculated this to be
    1581737 sq. kms.)

    10. Area of land under permanent crops in % = 3.8%

    11. Length of Roadways in India, including both pucca and kutcha=
    17,00000 kms. (Seventeen lakh kms.)

    12. Length of metal led roadways in India = 700000 kms. (seven lakh
    kms.)

    13. Area required by  17,00000 kms. of roads with an average width
    of 10 mts. = 17,000 sq. kms.

    14. The Population of India by the census of 2011 = 1210193422
    persons.

    15. The Agricultural Land per person in India = 0.14 ha. OR 1400 sq
    mts. OR 15069.474 sft.

    16. The Arable Land  per person in India = 0.1 ha. OR 1000sq.mts. OR
    10763.910 sft.

    17. On the Global Hunger Index, we are placed at place 67 out of 81
    rated countries. Even Rwanda is better than us at rank 60!


    III. What does all the above statistics REALLY mean for the Indian
    citizen?

    1. The amount of land available to each person for production of all
    that he consumes from organic sources, is about 15000 sft. This
    includes  i.) his food - cereals, pulses, oils, vegetables, fruit,
    spices, condiments, sugars, milk and all milk products, medicinal
    and other herbs, tea, coffee, cocoa and other beverages,  and
    everything else ii) his cleaning agents and toiletries iii) his
    clothing, bedding, furnishings, and such like iv) his furniture,
    paper, books and all stationery, and everything made of plantation
    products v) And a thousand things that have not occurred to me.
        Minus from that, land that is left fallow; or crops destroyed
    due to flooding, drought, salination, lack of labour, erosion of
    topsoil, destructive agricultural practices et al - and what does
    one have left? Less than 10000 sft. each.

    10000 sft. is just a 100ft x 100ft site.
    10000 sft. is about just 1/18th part of a cricket pitch.
    10000 sft. is about the area a child can run across in 50 steps.

    2. Every site that we carve out of agricultural land is taking the
    food out of the mouth of one person in India.

    3. Every acre of agricultural land that we convert to non-
    agricultural purposes, we are driving to total destitution and
    poverty 4 adults and 1 child.

    4. In the last decade Uttar Pradesh alone has lost 6 million (YES!)
    hectares of land to the development of the National Capital Region
    (NPR).
    The Yamuna Super Highway project includes plans for a high-tech city
    that will take away 45000 hectares of land that is being cultivated
    by 1191 villages. This is RICH agricultural land, maybe one of the
    best in the world, the legendary DOAB, that easily produces 3 crops
    and many intercroppings every year.
    This Yamuna Highway alone will take the last morsel away from the
    mouths of at least 484376 adults and double that many children.

    5. Every kilometer of a 10 meter width road that is built, will take
    away 1 ha. OR 10000 sq. mts. OR 107639 sft. of land, AND condemn to
    starvation at least 11 adults or 22 children.

    6. Every illegal immigrant into our country will displace one
    citizen to a nowhere land, for there is no land to feed even one
    person more. 

    7. Every child born, before one person dies, or to put it another
    way, every one person who does not die for one child born eats into
    the sparse land resource available to grow our food. 

    So every inch of good crop land that is diverted to other uses such
    as  an investment alternative in the form of sites; or mindless
    urban expansion, or a flamboyant race track that is obscene in its
    sheer waste; or SEC blocks; or 8 lane highways to accommodate the
    'car-pulation' bomb and the speedniks who want to reach everywhere
    in no time; they all condemn more and more to hunger, malnutrition,
    deprivation and even death.

    I have not been comprehensive enough. There is much more to say. So
    please feel welcome to speak. There are many of us 
    listening.

    Thank you.

waste, and farmers who know precisely when and how to plant, fertilize, irrigate, etc.This 1998 article says in 1990, per capita cropland in India was .20 hectares and projected availability in 2025 was 0.12 hectares

 Invitation to Geekup in Chennai

Zainab Bawa <bawaza...@gmail.com> Sep 04 04:34PM +0530
        
      You can't get away from JavaScript these days, can you? It's running
on back-end servers, on mobile devices, desktop apps, embedded devices
and of course is ubiquitous on the web. Speaking of ubiquity, Android
has grown in leaps and bounds over the past year or two. Despite
being plagued by issues such as fragmentation, it is a force to reckon with.
 
On Saturday, 8 September, we're bringing together four great speakers at
the Startup Centre in Chennai to talk about these and other topics. Mani
Doraisamy will talk about how an unassuming browser scripting language now
powers servers, phones and rich applications on the web and desktop.
Siddharta Govindaraj will talk about building rich applications for the web
using JavaScript.
 
On the Android front, Aravind Krishnaswamy will take us to the frontiers of
mobile technology to show us how far we've come. Isaac Wesley will end the
morning with a talk on Constructive Design for Android, encouraging us to
think of design as ""communication"" and not ""decoration.""
 
These talks are open to all, and will be held at the Startup Centre, S-4,
Alsa Mall, #45, Montieth Road, Egmore, Chennai from 10am to 1pm. Since the
venue has limited space, please RSVP on
http://geekup.in/2012/chennai-javascript-android so that we can make
adequate seating arrangements.
 
This GeekUp is a run-up event to JSFoo
Bangalore<http://funnel.hasgeek.com/jsfoo>on the 19-20 October and
Droidcon <http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon2012> on 2-3 November this
year.

I really like this idea.  I'm still hoping we can get the NIC to do a talk
with us and a feedback session.
 
This website is really an amazing opportunity.  This is basically the
government saying ""Ok data is out there, now let's see if people will
really use it.""  I think it is our job to make sure its purpose is
fulfilled and not really leave it to their discretion. When they have more
data, a mini hackathon, making sure they hear from us consistently about
usability and ofcourse requesting data are definitely things this group can
do.
 
I do like the idea of mirroring, not so much a place to host the data but a
place to also show its visualization and story telling potential really
showing what can be done when data is available.
 
ckan and socrata are both options. I actually think Open Governance India
is a good way. They did a great job on their site.

hi guys,
Given that Data.gov.in is live, should we contribute AND mirror these
datasets so that there is a govt maintained as well as community maintained
version of the same dataset ? Possibly use something like
http://ckan.org/to maintain the public version.
 
I personally feel it is important to centralize (and mirror) all possible
datasets for easier discovery.

Hi all,

Thought you might be interested in the following post... Jayesh has
built a map which allows you to calculate how much an autorickshaw
ride should cost!

Hopefully a blog on how he worked with the data will be following
shortly - keep an eye out for it. Thanks Jayesh, this is great to see!

Laura


==========

Hello School of Data,

Recently I read this blog post by Nigel Babu on the Salary converter
that he built. And since you asked for a data-wrangling-experience,
here's one that I have built. Well, this one does not crunch a lot of
data (for example from the UN, data.gov.in or the likes) but is meant
to be a straight forward visualization of Fares using a city-transport
mode commonly known as 'Rickshaw', in India.

The idea sprung for a competition (JS10K) where the task was to build
an app less than 10k in size. I wanted to build something very useful
in this limited size. Calculating Rickshaw fares are a nightmare for
people anywhere in India. Basically, you pay as per the meter-reading
for the vehicle (which has a conversion rule in many cities), which
in-turn is based on the amount of travel you have made. Sometimes,
even for the same travel the fares differ so much that it makes us
feel that we are cheated most of the time. I decided to visualize this
on a map (with all the associated rules) which shows you the maximum
fare you should be paying and a shortest alternative as well.

Well I didn't win the competition, but built a separate site for
people to use it - http://faremap.in. (the competition entry link is
http://10k.aneventapart.com/1/Entry/218)

Hope you like it.

Thank you,
Jayesh Gohel

My first email to this group. I have joined recently after a Delhi
Datameet on Open Data. I hope it may be sufficient introduction of
myself that I am not a data scientist but have keen interest in Open
Access (http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm) to Scholarly
Literature.

Now I looking for some good and tested software (preferable open
source) for a scientific data repository. Inspired by an article ""Data
Repositories for Medical Education Research by Alan Schwartz et al"" ,
I had narrowed down to ""Dataverse Network"" software
(http://thedata.org/DVN-software). I have successfully installed it on
my local server. However I find that there are some issues in
uploading data files ( maybe I have to explore it little further).
Moreover over, I feel it provide very little to customise its look and
feel.

I would be interested to know whether there are others in this group
who has experience with this software? What are other options
available to host data repository for a scientific organisation?

Datameet on Data Repository is most welcomed in Delhi.

OKF has split CKAN into two: the software <http://ckan.org> and a open data 
repository / hub <http://thedatahub.org> that runs on CKAN.  So you'd want 
to check out the latter.

I think we should try to get a  Q&A session with them to see if they can
1) walk us through the new site, 2) allow for us to have a public place for
feedback and complaints, 3) see if there are any joint projects we can do with

I recently joined the datameet group and following emails.
I am glad that you are considering exploring the Govt initiatives. As an officer in Government I will be happy to get the information required by the group to help you understand and contribute. 
I have some initial questions to work on in the previous mail. If there are anymore things I can help on I will gladly try.
Apart from release of data sets we can try to build tools that enable opening up data at department and office levels. For example  how a district collector can open up his office data and make it accessible. What tools he will need. 
Would you be happy to analyse data sets on free houses to poor, social benefits data, NREGA works data....the list is endless.

3608,Sumant Suresh Kulkarni,#topic/datameet/C7UW70iBgEw,16,2012-08-28 02:11:00,Re: [datameet] open data repository?,"Dear Nagarajan,It is great  to see the interest in opening up the government data. That would certainly help us understand lot of things. I'm trying to answer both of your questions. 
1. how a district collector can open up his office data and make it accessible?There can be data of two kinds, (a) Data in ledger and (b) Data available in electronic form. Opening up of the data depends on what form the data is available currently.
(a)  The data present in just ledgers (not as e-copy) can be difficult to share. To share it, it has to be converted into electronic from. A XML based representation of a database representation of the data can be created. Then the XML/database dump's can be made available to download by putting them on some sites. Even though this is a high effort task, it is worth doing as the data analysis can give many insights to the people and administrators as well. 
(b) The data present in electronic form (data entered in computer) is in some proprietary softwares provided to governments. Many such software do provide options to export the data into files (csv or XML). Once the data is exported to these formats, you can host these on some website and let people download them.
2. Would you be happy to analyse data sets on free houses to poor, social benefits data, NREGA works data?
We would be really ahppy to analyse these datasets, if they are provided to us. I believe that there are quite a few people with similar interest to analyse such data sets. The analysis, for sure will give some totally not obvious insights, which can, hopefully, be helpful to implement the schemes better. However, the insights will be as good as the data we get. If we get unaltered, complete data, we might be able to give better insights about it.

3609,Nagarajan M,#topic/datameet/C7UW70iBgEw,17,2012-08-28 05:01:00,Re: [datameet] open data repository?,"Very True Mr. Sumant. Regarding conversion of physical records to electronic form. Right now many of the records are being scanned and pdfs and jpgs are being created. For example the land records are maintained in a central server online for the past 8 years. All data before that is lying as a physical record dating back to 1960's is being scanned. Converting the image to text and making sense of it is a big challenge.
Much of the current work is being dont is MS Word and Excel but there is no systematic way of storing or publishing them. While some reports are consolidated at the central or state govt. level the data can be more granular and accurate if direct publishing at source is done. It will take time for such culture to emerge. But we can facilitate it.
By creating tools that help in pre-processed output that will help in publication. For example - when you apply for a permission related to land usage purpose it takes anywhere from 3 months to 6 months if all is well. Suppose we create a file tracking system that supports the office work and at the same time holds the data in an accessible machine readable format and when its plugged to the net, it creates a win win. This system can be used by any individual office which wants to do it....say a nagarpalika,village panchayat,a department,govt undertakings you name it.
What if we aggregate all such data on a central repository with automatic sync....your wish for unaltered data could actually come true.Let me know what you think?Regards,NagarajanWith Best Regards,Nagarajan M,  IASAsst. CollectorTharadDistrict BanaskanthaGujaratM : 099132 71733

3611,prashant khare,#topic/datameet/C7UW70iBgEw,19,2012-08-30 03:50:00,Re: [datameet] open data repository?,"Mr. Nagarajan,Appreciate the move that govt. has taken. But, since you are trying to provide the kind of services which are bringing better transparency it is important to adhere to best technical practices.As in his earlier post Sumant said, the data has to be in electronic form.  It totally makes sense on your behalf when you said that you are scanning all the data from 1960s onwards in PDFs and JPGs. But, it would actually make better sense that gradually you/we adapt to publishing the data which is ""ACCESSIBLE"" in nature.The data that you might provide us in separate scanned versions might not be enough as a stand-alone data-set and people may require different data-sets for their own purpose (which might be analysis of data for 'n' number of causes). And, its not just people, even the govt. departments might want to reuse data and some other time. So, publishing in 'accessible' formats is very important.  XML based representations like RDFs are really good methods since they also have potential to link the data with other data sets. I am sure, many of us over here in group are capable enough to help you on that just in case if you wish to seek assistance.You can take a look at how data.gov.uk i.e. UK govt's official data hub, publishes its data and the kind of accessible services it provides, I have personally tried to explore a lot into it and myself worked on scraping old systems having data to convert to more accessible formats. Coming onto the point where you said ""Much of the current work is being dont is MS Word and Excel but there is no systematic way of storing or publishing them"", I think it becomes utter important for you to judge what all fields of a given data set are meaningful enough to be published. If you have say 5000 records, for example, of various schemes that govt is planning to implement but is still as you termed it ""pre-processed"" and its status is liable to change with time. Creating an exclusive file tracker could be a way, but rather than that, technically speaking, if every file(in this case file of every record ) is given a separate unique identity on the network (call it a URI) and the data format is accessible (machine understandable and human-comprehensible) than it just needs to be updated on the back-end with its few fields being updated. I mean, its a lot of different means and ways, in which an organization might want to go ahead publishing the data. But, we -the people in this group and elsewhere too, are broadly a merger of 2 perspectives: 1)responsible citizens: we want the system to be transparent and the govt must share the data, that you are already planning a move; 2)Techies: We want data that is not just on the internet or some grave where we need to dig and read a file and go back home keeping a notes of data in our diaries to memorize, so rather, we want it accessible, we surely can talk on how to make things accessible!regards,Prashant"
3612,Nagarajan M,#topic/datameet/C7UW70iBgEw,20,2012-08-30 10:48:00,Re: [datameet] open data repository?,"Hi,@Nisha Thompson  Thanks for asking me about the barriers. Just thought it worthwhile to share with wider audience and hence wrote this article - 
http://govinspire.com/field-experience/177/want-to-innovate-in-governmentovercome-these-seven-challenges/ 
Regarding a platform for collaboration - There is a need for that and if we do something concrete, it can actually be a good model to start with.
@Prashant Khare Publishing via XML or RDF is the right thing to do. Just to suggest a use case (in case this gets you guys interested) Lets take a District Collectors Office. (He works closer to people and data is primary). What if he has a nifty tool that actually takes fields from a Word file and publishes to an xml data set.
 The fields can be standardised by providing a Word/excel Template for each and every order type. Order types include Arms licenses, Allotment of land for industrial,infrastucture,health,education etc purposes, hotel licenses,finance data etc. These have to modified for each state but will work uniformly within a state.
To create a full solution we can use the Drupal based Open Govt Platform www.Ogpl.gov.in which has a Data Management System. All we need is a way to capture the data at source and publish. This way when a collector wants to Open up data all he needs is to just install the system and hit publish. As you said the files can even be placed in a collection and accessed with a URI. These are things i dare to imagine with my limited knowledge.
In US,UK and EU countries there are non-profits and  tech consultants who create a lot a solutions with support from various Governments/agencies. In India all this is in a nascent stage. But this trend will only increase. We can help mainstream it sooner.

When they have more data, a mini hackathon, making sure they 
hear from us consistently about usability and ofcourse requesting data are definitely things this group can do. I do like the idea of mirroring, not so much a place to host the data but a place to also show its visualization and story telling potential really showing what can be done when data is available.  
ckan and socrata are both options. I actually think Open Governance India is a good way. They did a great job on their site. Nisha

      Hi Ankur,
We are going to put the slides and videos online. As far the projects go,
my sense is that it will be hard for the physical groups in Bangalore to
collaborate with someone remote, but if you can find a few other people in
Chennai who are willing to work with you on the course, might be worth
exploring a remote project.

3626,S Anand,#topic/datameet/blhYkyoOvgU,1,2012-08-05 18:35:00,Course and meetup on data,"Analytic techniques are becoming ever more important in industry as well as academia. Much can be learned by bringing these communities together. We are launching a new initiative to bring together people interested in analysis from different perspectives.
To start with, we are going to be organizing two activities; a course on ""Thinking with Data"" and a monthly workshop called ""Data Science meets Data Technology"" (DSDT). A brief description of the two is given below:
The Course:Rajesh and Anand are offering a course titled Thinking with Data at NIAS. It'll be 12 - 14 two-hour sessions every Monday starting Aug 27th. The course will cover:
Storytelling
Identifying an interesting topic
Pyramid principle
Structure of a storyWorking with data
Getting the data
Transforming the dataAnalysis
Estimation
Segmented averagesForecasting
Classification
Prototyping / sketchingVisual design
Types of representations
Perception and effectivenessEach module will consist of techniques, tools, case studies and exercises. In addition, every student will be assigned to project groups; each project group will be responsible for designing and executing a publishable project. Some programming (Python/HTML) and statistical knowledge will be presupposed in the main course, however, we provide access to all the background learning material for anyone who needs a refresher. 
The course is open to 80 people outside of NIAS and will cost Rs 1000 (for the whole semester). You may register at http://analysis.knofu.org/2012/08/02/thinking-with-data/
--------DSDT


Data Science Meets Data Technology (DSDT). While data is increasingly important in academia as well as in industry, the two worlds do not intersect each other all that often. DSDT is a forum for sharing ideas about data across disciplines and industries. The first DSDT meeting will be held at NIAS on August 18th. This is a small meeting; we only have room for about 25 people in total. Please let us know if you want to attend. If you want to be kept informed about future DSDT events, sign up for the mailing list at: http://analysis.knofu.org/2012/08/03/data-science-meets-data-technology/

 Sheepallenge: the virtual visualization competition

Ate Poorthuis <atepoo...@gmail.com> Aug 21 09:01AM -0400
        
      Hi all,
 
Floatingsheep is putting together a virtual
Ironsheep<http://www.floatingsheep.org/2012/04/matt-monica-and-ate-talking-about.html>competition
this semester:
Sheepallenge <http://www.floatingsheep.org/2012/08/sheepallenge.html>! In
early November, we'll share a super-secret data set with those who register
for the competition. You can mix, mash, and recompose the data in anyway
you choose. Submissions will be judged by a panel of sheep on their
aesthetic value and use of the data. There are absolutely no rules about
group size, composition or specific prerequisite GIS skills.
 
This is meant to be a low-barrier thing for anybody who wants to try out
some of those classroom mapping skills in the wild. Both Monica Stephens
and I are 'encouraging' the students from our Intro to GIS/Cartography
classes to participate as part of their course assignments. For more
details, check the Floatingsheep
blog<http://www.floatingsheep.org/2012/08/sheepallenge.html>.
You can register yourself, your group or your whole class (groups can be
changed at anytime) by visiting early
registration.<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGtCTmNzSXUtRkloWTFmbTY0eWloYkE6MQ>

Possible. How easy or difficult it is to control spammers on it?

I can give access to wordpress (probably install plugins to login
using Google/FB). Also we can use tagging feature of wordpress.

Not very hard to prevent spammers. Just require people to
register/login before editing - no anonymous edits.

Easy enough for users but hard enough for spammers. I think mediawiki
also has a captcha plugin

DATE: August 22, 2012TIME: 1:00 - 2:30 p.m. (Eastern Time)
EVENT WEBPAGE: http://www.niso.org/news/events/2012/dcmi/scientific_data/
ABOUT THE WEBINARÂ 

The past few years have seen increased attention to national and 
international policies for data archiving and sharing. Chief motivators 
include the proliferation of digital data and a growing interest in 
research data and supplemental information as a part of the framework 
for scholarly communication. Key objectives include not only 
preservation of scientific research data, but making data accessible to 
verify research findings and support the reuse and repurposing of data.
Metadata figures prominently in these undertakings, 
and is critical for the success of any data repositories or archiving 
initiative, hence increased attention to metadata for scientific data --
 specifically for metadata standards development and interoperability, 
data curation and metadata generation processes, data identifiers, name 
authority control (for scientists), Linked Data, ontology and vocabulary
 work, and data citation standards.
This NISO/DCMI webinar will provide a historical 
perspective and an overview of current metadata practices for managing 
scientific data, with examples drawn from operational repositories and 
community-driven data science initiatives. It will discuss challenges 
and potential solutions for metadata generation, identifiers, name 
authority control, Linked Data, and data citation.
SPEAKERSJane Greenberg, 
professor at the School of Information and Library Science (SILS) at the
 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and director of the SILS 
Metadata Research Center, is well known for research and writing on 
topics ranging from automatic metadata creation to metadata best 
practices, ontology research, Semantic Web, data repositories, thesauri,
 and scientific data curation. She has served as Principal Investigator 
or partner on a number of grants from the Institute of Museum and 
Library Services, National Science Foundation, and the National 
Institute of Health, and actively participates in organizations such as 
the American Library Association, American Society for Information 
Science and Technology, and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. Jane is
 the recipient of the 2012 Margaret Mann Citation from the Association 
for Library Collections & Technical Services (ALCTS).
Thomas Baker, Chief Information Officer of the 
Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, has recently co-chaired the W3C 
Semantic Web Deployment Working Group and the W3C Incubator Group on 
Library Linked Data.

3660,Lucy Chambers,#topic/datameet/90BzNFEw6yg,1,2012-08-15 03:05:00,Favourite Examples: Open Data in Action,"Hi Folks,

Thank you to many on the list who welcomes Laura and I while we were
in India over the past months.

While we were there, we received many requests for case studies
proving that Open Data has impact. I thought that I would share my
personal favourite example.

MP's expenses have been quite a hot topic here in Britain since a
scandal broke out a couple of years back on MP's using taxpayers money
to claim for outrageous expenses (from houses for their ducks [0] to
ridiculous expenses on second homes).

http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/15/mps-expenses-heather-brooke-foi

Possibly as a result of this scandal, this data is now published
proactively and regularly through the Independent Parliamentary
Standards Authority (although this site is very buggy particularly in
Chrome):

http://www.parliamentary-standards.org.uk/

I'm pleased to say, that this is actually one of my favourite examples
of Open Data in action in cleaning up how taxpayers money is spent. It
has apparently done so to the extent that journalists actually write
that it is now a boring topic. I quote from the Guardian [1]

""To be frank, these are getting pretty boring. This was always Ipsa's
plan. The rules are so transparent and tough, compared with the
corrupted scheme that caused the scandal of two years ago, that there
is very little an MP can do wrong. Now they are published regularly
and MPs also don't want to be caught cheating.""

I think that is a result :) (but I do hope journalists will keep their
eyes on this just in case as recently some new stories broke on
council spending! [2])

With all of the great work and growing interest in the field of data science, it has become very important for practitioners to be able to effectively communicate and present their findings. If you can't tell or present a compelling story, all too often the value of your work is lost. Extraordinary insight will always remain ordinary if a participating stakeholder (your audience) doesn't understand the data, the exploration, the outcome, and the opportunity. 

																																						This webinar brings together industry leading panelists to educate and encourage data professionals to learn more about the art and science of data visualization and digital storytelling. Attendees will also hear about the pros and cons of dashboards, infographics, and interactive visualizations. Whether your skills are creative, analytical, or both â€“this event will be invaluable as you navigate the future trends and requirements in the big data era. 


Panelists include:

Robert Kosara, Visual Analytics Researcher 
																																						Robert is Associate Professor of Computer Science at UNC Charlotte, currently on Sabbatical at Tableau Software. His main research interests are information visualization for visual communication and theoretical foundations of visualization. 

																																						Richard Snee, Executive Chairman, Data Science Summit 
																																						Most recently Richard was VP Marketing at Greenplum, a Division of EMC, where he led Big Data initiatives including the creation of the first Data Scientist Summit in Las Vegas, May 2011. He is currently a partner in the development of the Data Science Central community and planning the 2013 Data Science Summit.

the Open Government Platform (OGPL) as its lead story (written by Neeta 
Verma, Alka Mishra, and D.P. Mishra).

# OPEN GOVERNMENT PLATFORM #

## An Open Source Solution to Democratizing Access to Information and 
Energizing Civic Engagement ##

By
NEETA VERMA
Sr. Technical Director

ALKA MISHRA
Sr. Technical Director

D. P. MISRA
Principal Systems Analyst

If government could release these datasets in open format for people to use 
& reuse, a whole lot of new innovative apps could be built around these 
datasets to provide better, customized services to citizens.

Online publishing of Government data in open format shall play an important 
role in enhancing transparency and accountability of the government. It 
shall enable new forms of citizen engagement & innovation in citizen 
service delivery. More customized & personalized services could be offered 
to citizens. When implemented at large scale it shall bring a paradigm 
shift in development of e-governance applications. At NIC we have recently 
developed an Open Government Platform (OGPL) to enable government 
ministries & departments to launch their open data initiative.


### CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW ###

OGPL as a product caters to two sets of users - the government and the 
citizen/civil societies. It facilitates government departments to 
contribute their datasets, Apps, tools, documents, services etc., which 
gets validated and published, after passing through a predefined workflow 
to the citizen interfacing data portal. The single-point citizen interface 
is designed in such a way that catalogs can be searched with ease and 
datasets can be accessed/downloaded in various open formats. It also 
provides a platform for citizens and civil societies to engage with 
government on various aspects of socio economic development.

OGPL also facilitates building of subject specific communities through 
Citizen engagement modules. Communities shall discuss online the kind of 
datasets, government should release and also what kind of apps should be 
developed around these datasets. This shall provide first hand information 
to government as well as developer communities on public demand and 
prioritize their schedules accordingly.


### OGPL COMPONENTS ###

OGPL essentially consists of three major modules

        * Dataset Management System
        * Data Portal
        * Monitoring and Management
        * Dashboard


### DATASET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ###

Dataset Management system or DMS shall be used by all contributing 
ministries, departments as well as organisations using which, authorized 
officers of the departments can contribute datasets, documents, services, 
tools and apps which shall then be processed through a predefined workflow 
of moderation & approval to ensure that datasets being released in public 
domain are in compliance with existing acts & policies of the government 
concerning privacy, security etc.

Through DMS each Ministry/Department can contribute their datasets in the 
form containing a set of Standard Metadata elements. After passing through 
various stages of moderation and approvals, these datasets gets published 
on the data portal viz. data.gov.in


### DATA PORTAL ###

Data Portal is the citizen facing frontend of the OGPL which shall provide 
single point access to all the datasets, apps as well as services. Portal 
has a strong component of search, discovery as well as citizen engagement. 
The development of the data portal is in compliance with the Guidelines for 
Indian Government Websites (GIGW).

This Citizen interfacing Data Portal would also have a Communities 
component built into the system. This component facilitates 
Forums/Discussions around various datasets, apps available on the portal as 
well as platform to express and discuss the kind of datasets & apps they 
would like to have. This shall give first hand input to development 
community for building new components, apps. It shall also give input to 
departments as what kind of datasets are more useful and accordingly can 
raise the priority of their release.


### MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD ###

Monitoring and management dashboard of OGPL helps government monitor & 
manage its Open Data Programme through three dimensions
        * Metrics, analytics & feedback from citizens: Metrics help understand 
amount of datasets uploaded, updated by different Departments. Frequency of 
upload is also available on a single dashboard.
        * Analytics module gives use perspective in terms of their usage of 
datasets, Number of downloads, aggregated ratings provided to datasets 
determine their value and to some extent quality of data released by 
government.
        * Feedback from citizens provide government with first hand input from 
citizens on quality, relevance of datasets, new datasets needed, kind of 
apps need to be developed etc.
        
        Open government platform can be used in multiple ways. One can directly 
publish their datasets after one time registration & authentication. 
Departments could build their subject specific catalogues through a cloud 
based services of OGPL. One can also ask for independent installation of 
OGPL with customized look & feel. OGPL can be used by any central or state 
government department, organisations as well as district and panchayat 
administrations. It can also be used by private organisations as well as 
non government organization and civil societies to bring in more 
transparency in their functioning.

        OGPL isn't simply about setting up a new web platform, moving to cloud 
computing or adopting open standards but it's about establishing a platform 
to enhance transparency, accountability & foster development of Innovative 
applications to better serve the citizens & other stakeholders. Open 
government data is gaining a lot of popularity & acceptance with 
governments across the world. Its led by government themselves, development 
communities, international organisations. OGPL is a perfect platform for 
them to launch their open data initiative.
        
***************

Boxes:

### 1. Note by BK Gairola ###

In India, National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) has been 
recently notified by the Government. According to this policy, all 
government departments shall release their datasets in open format for 
citizens and other stakeholders to freely use & reuse. To make these 
datasets easily accessible by citizens, policy has also mandated NIC to 
provide technology solution for establishing an Open Data Portal 
(http://data.gov.in) for Departments, Subordinate Offices and 
Organizations. OGPL implementation in India is being executed by NIC, DeitY 
in close coordination with DST.

OGPL is an open source product with generic architecture, which would 
easily facilitate other organizations and institutions to adopt for their 
open data initiatives. Communities could also contribute further by 
developing innovative apps around datasets and also enhancing the product 
in terms of features & functionalities.

The purpose of the platform is to enhance access and use of government data 
to foster innovation, promote transparency, accountability and public 
participation. I am sure it shall go a long way in democratizing the 
government information.


### 2. INDO-US COLLABORATION ###

Open Government Platform (OGPL) was developed jointly by India & US 
government as a result of announcement made by President Obama and Prime 
Minister Manmohan Singh during the Indo-US Open Government Dialogue in 
2010. OGPL leverages on the best practices & features of the India’s 
“India.gov.in” and the “Data.gov” of United States.National Informatics 
Centre (NIC) from Government of India and General Services Administration 
(GSA) of United States executed the development of OGPL. Open Government 
Platform, developed to promote access to government data and information 
and energize citizen engagement was launched by Hon’ble Minister of 
Communications & IT and HRD, Govt. of India during a press conference held 
on 30th March 2012 in New Delhi in presence of Dr. Sam Pitroda, Advisor to 
Prime Minister of India. Secretary(DEITY), DG(NIC) & Joint Secretary, MEA

### 3. OGPL – AN OPEN SOURCE SOLUTION ###

Open Government Platform is completely developed using Open Source Stack. 
In fact complete management of the collaborative development of OGPL by two 
teams stationed in two continents of the world was also handled using open 
source tools.It complies with the best practices of open source 
development, which helps in leveraging the strengths of future versions of 
the open source base products used in development of OGPL.

OGPL being an open source initiative not only facilitates cost saving in 
terms of software and licenses but also facilitates community participation 
in terms of further development of product with additional components and 
innovative apps around the published datasets. This shall define a paradigm 
shift in the manner electronic government applications shall be developed 
in future. The entire source code is made available to public for review, 
feedback and participation for further development and enhancement.


### 4. CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT ###

OGPL has a strong component of Citizen engagement. Citizens can view, 
download datasets as well express their opinion on the quality of datasets, 
they can rate the datasets on a scale of 1 to 5. One can embed a dataset in 
their blog or web site as well as contact the owner of the datasets for any 
query or clarification. One can also publish or connect the datasets on 
their social media pages such as facebook, twitter etc. for wider reach.

Ratings given by citizen are transparently shared on the portal in terms of 
number of views, current star rating which help new visitor understand 
quality of data sets, its popularity. Portal also enables visitors to 
submit their ideas, feedbacks and as well suggest datasets they would like 
government to release in open domain. These ideas are further rated by 
citizens to help government allocate priority in release of data sets.

Berlin 10 Open Access Conference, Stellenbosch, South Africa
 
CALL FOR ELECTRONIC POSTERS – SUBMIT AN ABSTRACT TO THE BERLIN 10 OPEN ACCESS CONFERENCE ELECTRONIC POSTER DISPLAY
 
Proposals are now being invited for the Berlin 10 Open Access Conference electronic poster display, which will showcase Open Access initiatives from all corners of the globe.

 
Electronic 
posters will be displayed at the venue on electronic display boards for the duration of the Conference as well as on the Conference web site
(at www.berlin10.org
), and will also be promoted via social networking tools. Electronic 
poster proposals will be reviewed by the Conference Advisory Committee and evaluated according to their contribution to the Conference theme:
Networked scholarship in a networked world: participation in Open Access. 
Successful proposals and electronic 
posters will highlight the importance of research sharing within an Open Access environment, and will link to the theme and sub-themes for this Conference. Given that the Conference will be held in Africa, the sub-themes to be explored are concomitant
 with the development and transformative agenda of Open Access.  The sub-themes are:

Transformation through Open Access
- Transformative impact of Open Access
- Funding and sustainability
- Transformation in publishingOpen Access and other forms of openness
- Open Education
- Access to research data and cultural heritage
- Open Research
- Grey literatureBenefits of Open Access for scholarship and wider society
- Open Access and empowerment
- Open Access and innovation
- Open Access and economic growthOpen Access and improving assessment of research and scholarly publishing


- Article level-metrics
- Assessment metrics
- National assessment exercisesNetworked scholarship
- Global scholarship
- South-South coalitions
- Interdisciplinary research
- Early career researchers
- Student engagement
 
Abstract requirements
 
Abstracts of no more than 250 words in length are invited for review by the Advisory Committee. Submissions must be received no later than
31 August 2012. Acceptance notifications will be issued by
15 September 2012. Please complete the poster 
proposal abstract template and submit to 
is...@sun.ac.za. For the announcement and details to submit, please visit
www.berlin10.org. 
 
What is an Electronic Poster or ePoster?
 
An electronic poster utilises a large monitor and computer to display multimedia versions of a poster. It gives an opportunity for a computer savvy presenter in the poster session to more effectively convey information that would not necessarily
 be possible with a traditional printed poster. It also enhances visualisation to attract interest of attendees. Electronic posters are intended to provide a display of information that is not possible with a traditional printed poster. Embedding multimedia
 content, along with static elements, such as titles, logos, and summaries, would be a good way to convey information. Examples of dynamic visual elements include videos, slide shows, animated charts or graphs, scrolling text, or 3D rotation of a model.
The intention of an electronic poster does not include attracting visitors to stay for a long oral, video, or slideshow presentation. Display elements can either loop for a minute or less, or be activated and controlled by the poster presenter
 on command. Remember, you are to interact with those who are interested in your electronic poster, not give a presentation to an audience.
 
Guidelines
 
1.      
Please create your electronic poster using MSPowerPoint or OpenOffice presentation software.
2.      
The electronic poster can consist of 1 to 5 slides.
3.      
Use animation and multimedia content to enhance your electronic poster.
4.      
Set the electronic poster up as a slide show, with slide transitions included.
5.      
It will be your own responsibility to ensure that the electronic poster displays correctly on the day prior to the start of the Conference. All slide shows will be pre-uploaded by the 6th of November 2012.
6.      
The poster title and your name should be clearly displayed on each slide.
7.      
No audio speakers will be available.
8.      
The electronic poster stations will have no connection to the Internet. Therefore please do not embed any items that require Internet connection.

9.     After being set up, the electronic poster should be able to loop without any human intervention (e.g. avoid clickable hyperlinks).

10.  The final electronic poster will be subject to quality control.
 
 
Please submit your completed ePoster by 15 October 2012 by e-mailing it to:
ism...@sun.ac.za . ePosters are to be displayed throughout each day of the Conference.

3707,Srinidhi SampathKumar,#topic/datameet/3LXJhdYE4DE,1,2012-07-13 21:51:00,"Open data workshop- Chennai, 2012","Hi,

In the spirit of furthering the conversation of open data, and to keep the momentum of the open data camp going, Transparent Chennai is organising a three day workshop on understanding, visualising and mapping data in Chennai in August 2012.
Complementing previous events in Bangalore and Hyderabad, this event will focus on training activists, researchers and students to work with data. Different from a data camp, this will be a workshop where participants will learn about open data, data visualisation, spatial data and practical issues that come up when working with data in various forms.
Working with Data:

A Workshop on Understanding, Visualising and Mapping DataChennai, August 2012
A Transparent Chennai EventDeveloped and delivered by Sajjad, Sumandro and Shashank  

DATES 3rd, 4th and 5th of August 2012.
BACKGROUND
After the first Data Meet in Bangalore, there was a wide discussion among people who are interested in open data but who do not have the skill set or technical background to materialise their thoughts of making the data open. The whole idea of training was formulated through these limited yet useful discussions. Experts in the field of open data were contacted to provide hands-on training to the people who use data the most for various crucial reasons.
Please register here: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFVWNWR6ZXdCeTlqVHFwLU9TQkZraFE6MQ 
WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO LEARN
Understanding various formats of data, diverse possibilities of data visualisation and effective tools for doing so, with a special focus on web-based tools.
How to think through projects involving collection, processing and visualisation of data.
Introduction to software packages and methods for visualising quantitative data, creating geo-visualisation and undertaking participatory mapping.
The connection between data technologies and rights to access and use data.
WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT TO LEARN
Statistics and econometrics: though you should learn elements of these to work with data.
Database softwares: though knowledge of SQL and other databases are quite important when working with large data sets.
Computer languages: though some languages like Python and JavaScript are very helpful in working with data.
Anything related to Big Data: though we will briefly discuss what Big Data means.
WORKSHOP
It will be a three day workshop. The first day will demystify various aspects of working with data ranging of technical understanding of various data storage formats to questions of legality and data rights. The second day will focus on data visualisation, and collecting, cleaning, managing of data). Sessions on both these days will involve presentations on the topics concerned but at the same time will demand inputs from the participants regarding their own experiences in working with data. This will ensure a dialogue between actual data challenges felt by the participants in their own work and technical possibilities and methods.
The third day will have three longish successive sessions on specific data visualisation tasks -- gis and geo-visualisation, participatory mapping and web-based data visualisation. These will be hands-on sessions where the participants will simultaneous learn about the tools and start working with them.
SESSIONS

DataCamps, Workshops and Hackathons are being planned for various cities in the next few months. Since we are not a formal organization it has been very difficult for some of these groups to get sponsorship support. I think this requires us to formalize a tiny bit. I will be meeting with NGOs who can take corporate money and sponsorship funds on our behalf and distribute them to the various groups for events. This will hopefully mean that all potential sponsors go through one NGO and then we assign point people for each of the events so that they can use the funds as they need. 
2) Website - Thej is updating the site and adding a wordpress blog. Google Groups do not scale well and we are now approaching 300 members and all our content and knowledge that this group is generating is being buried extremely quickly. So it will be good to have some static content living somewhere. List of downloaded Indian data available and event sites etc. 
Please use this thread to communicate other concerns and respond to the above two points with your thoughts and suggestions.Nisha

Student Conference on Conservation Science (http://www.sccs-bng.org/) this weekend. There will be a session on 4th of August at IISc, from 7pm to midnight, where we
 will encourage students and interested participants to engage in data 
visualisation exercises (largely for the first time). While most researchers routinely produce 
graphs/ charts for the scientific publications, we think that 
visualising data for the public is different. Also, Current Conservation (CC) is interested in 
producing data spreads/ posters where we take data from scientific 
studies/ sources and relate them to other kinds of data (from other 
sources - governement websites/ economic databanks) to produce 
comprehensive (and compelling) visual stories of processes outside of 
biology that might be relevant to conservation.This is a student conference held once a year and the third time it's being done in India. Master and PHD students from all over South Asia and Africa will be there sharing their research. 
This
 workshop will be a first-of-its-kind initiative for this conference, and we are 
trying to figure out things to include that will be useful but also a 
fun experience for participants. We will provide the datasets and anything of interest is produced during the workshop, it will be published in future issues of the 
magazine as well as on the CC website.So if you are a data visualizer and want to help teach some new people about data visualization please let me know if you can help on Saturday.  We will also be having a small side meeting after tomorrow's meeting at Jaaga to go through the final details of the the workshop.

## Details
The Open Knowledge Foundation is an international not-for-profit with a
mission to open up the world's data, build data-literacy and promote
evidence-based policymaking. Working in 3 broad fields — open-government,
open research and open cultural heritage — the activities of the foundation
are focussed around projects, working groups and local meetups.

The talk will be very informal, and focus on Data Journalism
(datajournalismhandbook.org), but will also touch on data management for
governments (ckan.org), the teaching of data literacy (schoolofdata.org)
and explaining the meaning of the numbers behind government expenditure
(openspending.org).

## More Details

The Data Journalism Handbook was born at a 48-hour workshop at MozFest 2011
in London. It subsequently spilled over into an international,
collaborative effort involving dozens of data journalism's leading
advocates and best practitioners — including from the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC, the Chicago Tribune, Deutsche Welle, the
Guardian, the Financial Times, Helsingin Sanomat, La Nacion, the New York
Times, ProPublica, the Washington Post, the Texas Tribune, Verdens Gang,
Wales Online, Zeit Online and many others.  Ms. Chambers was one of the
editors of the book.

GWF 2013 Call for Abstracts Dear colleague,

Geospatial Industry is growing like never before. Today, it is no longer
considered a subset of IT but has gradually evolved into a full-fledged
vertical in itself with the power to empower various other user domains.
The usage of this technology has revolutionised the way we work and live.
The value that this technology has added is of immense benefit to
businesses and society as a whole. Now is the time to monetise the values
added so far and take the applicability of these technologies to the next
level. Geospatial World Forum is a conference cum exhibition which has
always invoked the geospatial community with its relevant and
thought-provoking themes. This year, the conference which is scheduled from
13-16 May 2013 at Beurs World Trade Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands aims
at increasing our understanding of the concept of Monetising the value
added by geospatial industry so far with its theme “Monetising Geospatial
Value and Practices”. In today’s era of economic turmoil, and competition,
there is a drive towards increasing the ROI of government run programmes
and private businesses for sustainable growth of the economy. Relating to
this scenario, the conference would provide a congenial platform for
discussing the business case of geospatial technologies and their applications.

YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AT THIS PREMIER GEOSPATIAL EVENT!

To draw the maximum benefit out of this opportunity, we invite you to
participate actively in the conference and submit abstracts on various
themes related to geospatial technologies and applications.

============================================================

Rajasthan Rainfall Data (1957 to 2011)

Data Source :
- -------------
http://waterresources.rajasthan.gov.in/Daily_Rainfall_Data/Rainfall_Index.htm

The rain data was scraped as part of Scrapathon held in Bangalore 21st
July 2011.
Intially I used scraperwiki, but the huge amount of data made it to timeout all
the time :) so I wrote a simple python script to do it. You can find the same at
http://code.thejeshgn.com/snippets/src/tip/scrapers/rajasthan_rain_water/scrape.py


Data:
- -----
Data is in the SQLITE file data.sqlite, in a table called rainfall.
It has 6,61,459 rows.
Columns:
DISTRICT, STATION, YEAR, MONTH, DAY, RAIN_FALL, PAGE_ID

PAGE_ID refers to the ID in the table webpages which lists the
webpages from where
these data where scraped. It will help you incase you want to cross check.
The rest of the columns are self explanatory.

I have signed the SQLITE database using my GPG keys and the signatrues
are inside the file data_gpg_signature.sig

You can download my public key from any keyserver or from
http://biglumber.com/x/web?pk=C7D419119893ADAF27B0FCAABFFC8DD3C06DD6B0

You know how to get in touch with me in case of questions.

3rd Symposium on Computing for Development
Co-located with COMSNETS
January 11-12, 2013
Bangalore, India
http://dev2013.org/

Important Dates:

Submissions due: September 7, 2012 (11:59pm UTC) - firm deadline
Author notification: October 26, 2012
Camera-ready: December 7, 2012
Conference: January 11-12, 2013

DEV 2013 provides an international forum for research in the design and
implementation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for
social and economic development. In particular, we focus on emerging
contexts where conventional computing solutions are often inappropriate
due to various contextual factors - including, but not limited to, cost,
language, literacy, and the availability of power and bandwidth.

Papers should describe original and previously unpublished research.
Three metrics will be applied to judge papers: (a) Relevance of the
problem for development; (b) Novelty of the technical solution; (c)
Evaluation of the solution, making a case for development-focused
impact. All DEV paper submissions should either provide or directly
motivate a novel technical solution that has direct implications for
development. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Networks/Systems/Security/Architecture
     Low-cost wireless connectivity
     Intermittent networks and systems
     Power-efficient systems
     Low-cost computing devices
     Mobile systems and applications
     Mixed networks, e.g., telephony and IP
     Special-purpose sensor systems
     Security challenges in developing regions

HCI/Applications
     User interfaces for low-literacy populations
     Multi-lingual computing
     User-interfaces for low-cost devices
     Participatory methods and user-centered design
     Accessibility to disabled populations in developing regions
     Design and evaluation of applications for health, microfinance,
education, agriculture, entertainment

AI/NLP/Data Mining/Speech/Vision
     Machine learning techniques for large-scale data analysis in
development contexts
     Adapting content and applications to local languages and education
levels
     Understanding social relationships and information flows in
disadvantaged societies
     Speech interfaces and speech recognition for low-resource languages
     Development of new AI-centric tools/solutions for development
     Computer vision challenges in development

We also welcome papers outside of these topics that address the DEV
focus on computing innovations supporting social and economic development.

We need a researcher to carry out a survey/mapping study.

It is a mapping of the kind of data available within five or six government
departments, including a few at the state government level (possibly Tamil
Nadu), and analysis of:

 0. What data is available electronically, and what should?
 1. How could this information be opened up?
 2. How opening it up would help other departments.
 3. How opening it up would help civil society and businesses.

In both 2. and 3., you would be positing use cases, with a few interviews
to back it up.

We're estimating this would take around six to eight weeks.  Do drop me an
e-mail if you might be interested in this.

Regards,

It is worthwhile for everyone on this list to closely read this essay and check out the footnoted references and linked citations. 
However I don't quite buy the proposition that the alternative to open digital data is the informal, fuzzy and customary relations around which state databases in print and paper have been historically organised. It's not like things were any better in the old days, but it's true that they may become even worse when digitisation facilitates vertical control by a few corporates. 
Folks like Solly Benjamin, Bhuvna Raman and Lawrence Liang have for years made a fetish of illegality, informality and piracy, as this is how information is shared and valued by the poor (indeed it is their ""culture""). In this view, opaque customs and social practices are the best defence for the disenfranchised against the digitisation and corporate control. 
I've long found this to be a deeply conservative, technophobic and at times almost aesthetic critique, but this article challenges the seeming radicalism of the open data arguments by placing both sides in context. It certainly made me rethink my own position, and appreciate why Google and others embrace the open data movement. 
I look forward to hearing what others on this list think. To Rahul Gonsalves (as they say in the U.S.), ""thanks for sharing"". :)

Fork, Commit, Merge, - sounds like a clarion call for an onward march? This is the mantra for HasGeek's data hacknight, to be held between July 14-15, at the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), in Bangalore, and simultaneously in Pune, at AmiWorks.


The data hacknight is open to geeks, enthusiasts, designers, mathematicians and statisticians to work with different datasets on projects ranging from discovering unknown patterns in data to representing data in various visual forms. The hacknight is also open to individuals who want to work with tools such as R, Pig, Excel or even Hadoop to discover the possibilities and challenges that exist when working with data. Participants can also work on creating new repositories by scraping data off various sources.


To register for the hacknight, visit: http://beta.hacknight.in/fifthelephant/bangalore2012 or http://beta.hacknight.in/fifthelephant/pune2012. You can propose an idea, link to datasets you already have and form teams to work on your projects. 


Details of the Bangalore data hacknight are:

Date and Time: July 14-15, 2PM to 8AM
Venue: Centre for Internet and Society, 2nd C Cross, Domlur 2nd Stage, Bangalore

Tutorials will be organized in a peer-to-peer format at the venue, and mentors will be present to guide participants during the process of hacking.

Food, beverages and facilities will be provided to all participants during the hacknight. Participants are expected to bring their own laptops.

The data hacknight has been organized as part of a larger conference on big data, analytics and cross-industry applications called The Fifth Elephant. The hacknight is free for all conference attendees. For others, the registration fee is Rs. 500. 

 
The Bangalore data hacknight is sponsored by Lukup, a company that provides interactive content for TV and mobile devices.

3756,Shekhar Krishnan,#topic/datameet/uGQLFwO9T7s,1,2012-07-07 02:55:00,Fwd: Pad.ma Update: Call For Fellowships,"---------- Forwarded message ----------From: ""Namita"" <nam...@altlawforum.org>Date: Jul 7, 2012 8:05 AMSubject: Pad.ma Update: Call For Fellowships
To:  <padma-a...@pad.ma>

PAD.MA - is an online
    archive of densely text-annotated video material, primarily footage
    and not films. The entire collection is searchable and viewable
    online, and is free to download for non- commercial use. We see PAD.MA as a way of
    opening up a set of images, intentions and effects present in video
    footage, that conventions of video- making, editing and
    spectatorship  have tended to suppress. 
    This is our first call for fellowships and we would like to
      connect with people from diverse backgrounds and interests, who
      like to work creatively on video, film, digital and offline
      archives or collections.  We are offering two types of
      fellowships.  
The first is a call to work with online video, writing
        about video and film, and creative combinations of the two.
The second is a call for those interested in research and
        writing on early film histories in India.
Please distribute these fellowship calls widely.
________
1. Pad.ma Fellowship for Experiments with Video Archives  
Over the last 4 years, through many contributions from groups and
      individuals, Pad.ma has built a growing collection of documentary
      footage, contemporary art video, cinema, performing and classical
      arts, lectures, long interviews and so on. We now want to open the
      archive up to collaborations, video contributions from surprising
      and disparate sources, experiments in writing about, displaying
      and sharing video. 
We invite proposals for fellowships with Pad.ma, especially those
      interested in working with video and archives in the following
      ways
-        Writing on existing footage in the archive: Many essays
      on Pad.ma are a commentary on a set of videos, or link disparate
      videos in collections.  See examples at http://essays.pad.ma
-        Contribution of an existing collection of videos to
      Pad.ma: The contribution can be of a specific set of videos that
      are linked thematically, or sourced from a project such as
      documentary films or existing archives. An example of this is
      Kolar Gold Fields footage sourced from the film 'After the
      Gold'(J.Nair). See https://pad.ma/grid/title/project==Kolar%20Gold%20Fields%20and%20Mines
The project proposal must include transcription and
      annotation of videos, where possible extended to a written essay. 
-        Software development: Pad.ma is always looking for
      programmers - amateurs or professionals - who are interested in
      extending the software behind Pad.ma (http://pan.do/ra), or who might
      want to use the Pad.ma API (http:/pad.ma/api) to build
      interesting applications. 

-        Pad.ma also invites general scholarship on material from
      early film archives, the Internet Archive's moving image library,
      and other offline sources. We also encourage research and
      exploratory writing on popular and mass cultures online, that
      culls from Youtube and other online video platforms. These
      materials can be drawn together from diverse sources - an example
      in Pad.ma is the collection of the Radia tapes that are recordings
      of conversations between power brokers and media houses that were
      leaked to the public. The collection can be used for analysis,
      investigative journalism, but also as a script for a play or film.
      See https://pad.ma/grid/title/list==zi:The%20Radia%20Tap%28e%29s
Duration of Fellowship: 6 Months
        Remuneration: 15,000 per month over 6 months, to be
      disbursed in 3 installments
The fellowship will commence in September, 2012 and will
      culminate in a seminar-workshop in February, 2012 for the Pad.ma
      fellows. Maximum number of fellows chosen will be 8.
Please apply with a statement of your research interest (1 page
      or 500 word outline) and plan for the fellowship and a copy of
      your CV. You can also send a writing sample and additional links
      to videos, images and other files, using host services such as http://hostb.org.
      We may require a meeting in Mumbai or Bengaluru before final
      decision on the proposals.
The fellowship is open for non-Indian participants, but funding
      for travel to workshop and other travel, if required, has to be
      raised separately. Applicants can be of any educational or
      disciplinary background.
Last date of submission of proposals: 1st August, 2012
      Date for deciding proposals: 24th August, 2012
      Write to Namita A. Malhotra: n...@pad.ma 


2. Pad.ma Research Fellowship in Film Histories
While the focus of Pad.ma thus far has primarily been on footage,
      we would like to open Pad.ma out to an exploration of film
      studies, history and technology. Technology does not merely change
      the way films are made or seen, but also the way that it is
      studied, and film studies has travelled a long way from the time
      that one had to make notes in the dark to the control over the
      temporal flow of the film brought by video. Through this
      fellowship  we are interested in exploring the possible futures of
      film studies when it meets new technologies and the internet which
      allows for different ways in which we can categorize, retrieve and
      write about the moving image.
Celebrating forty years of copyright-free cinema in (1952 being
      the current threshold) amidst the hundred years of Indian cinema
      this year, we intend to upload pre-1952 films on to Pad.ma  and
      open them out to future collaborations with film historians and
      scholars. Fellows are encouraged to apply with a statement of
      their research interests, the films that they would like to work
      with on pad.ma
      and the kind of materials around the film that they would bring
      into conversation with the film.
Duration of Fellowship: 6 Months (with a possible
      extension to a year subject to future funding)
        Remuneration: 15,000 per month over 6 months, to be
      disbursed in 3 installments
Maximum number of fellows chosen will be 4. There will be
      additional fellowships administered via Jadavpur University Media
      Lab, and the School of Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru
      University. 
There will be a board of mentors including leading film scholars
      who will guide the independent fellows. There will also be a
      workshop at the beginning and the end of the fellowship period. 
Please apply with a statement of your research interest and plan
      for the fellowship, a copy of your CV and one sample piece of
      writing. You can also send a writing sample and additional links
      to videos, images and other files, using host services such as http://hostb.org.
      We may require a meeting in Mumbai or Bengaluru before a final
      decision on the proposals.

      Last date of submission of proposals: 1st August, 2012

http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/ ) or Federal Reserve Economic Data. Basically this one website contains thousands of economic data pertaining to the US in a time series format. 
Does there exist a similar source of data for India? For example, every time I need to get some govt data, I go hunting across the RBI, SEBI, Planning Commission and sundry ministries' websites, and the formats in each of these sites is different, making it a really tough exercise to get data for analysis. 
I'm sure it makes eminent sense to have a similar repository for India. It could be implemented in an open-sourced manner, where an initial bunch of people decide on standard formats, etc. and then you have volunteers writing scripts to translate data from various Indian websites to this repository. I also think there is enough vested commercial interest in getting this kind of data together that it might be possible to get sponsorship for the initiative.

Data-driven folks,


I have been following this group as an observer from the sidelines. I am sorry to have missed the event this weekend, sounds like it was a good event.
The work you are all doing will accrue benefits for startups, NGOs, academics and policy makers over time.


At the risk of spamming some folks who are strictly academics, I wanted to mention a full-time job opportunity available right now for someone who wants to apply their data mastery to an immediate problem in Indian agriculture, that of water scarcity. 
We have a portfolio company 
that is looking for a data specialist to lead business intelligence.


This company is backed by Vinod Khosla.


If this is something of interest to one of you, please reach out to me personally.


Thanks for your time, I look forward to meeting many of you personally.
Mark

Thank you for the kind words. 
Process: Mostly follows any typical web application development. Though the first step will differ in treatment style. So, here are the steps followed. 
In this case the 'script' is crucial part of data-visualization. What information school and students will be interested in? What will help them? 
Decision on data format conversion and storage. Design of database - SQL Vs No SQL etc. User Experience design, the flow. 
User interface designActual developmentTesting and Deployment. Tools used. 
Awk and Ruby script for data conversion. We took help of MS Access too for reading the labels properly as the original format was MS Fox Pro. 
Ruby on Rails.

My colleague, Laura Newman, and I will be in Bangalore from 24th July - we would love to meet up with those interested in Open Data (really gutted to be missing the meetup in a couple of days' time (23rd). - please let us know how it goes!)
We are also thinking about possibly trying to organise an event out there e.g. a 'Data-Day' or hackday with some local data to bringpeople together who are interested in these types of projects. I work on a project called OpenSpending.org and am particularly keen to get a group together who are interested in government money, taxes, subsidies etc. Laura works on a new initiative called the 'School of Data' - http://schoolofdata.org/ so is interested in meeting people to find out what they would be most interested in learning data-skills-wise.
Meetup could be formal or very informal. Does this sound like something which would be of interest? Please let us know :) We're also looking for suggestions for places where this could be held. 
We are planning on attending the Fifth Elephant event, so will be happy to meet up with people there, but maybe it makes sense to have something additional? Btw - regarding Fifth Elephant both of us have submitted talks on our topics:

3799,Chirag Anand,#topic/datameet/LylsuWC9k_Q,1,2012-05-05 00:24:00,Delhi meetup,"Hello,

This is regarding the Delhi data meetup. A few of us met and discussed
the following issues, and how they should be discussed:

Two aspects for the conference/camp/meet-up

1. Technicality:
    - Talking about Input/Output/Outcome as a whole
    - How to procure data at the grass-root level
    - What to do with data after we've got it
    - What impact it may create?

2. Getting government to release their data

    - How difficult it is to get data from government
        -> There should be a handbook for this

    - We should aid government in making their data open
        -> Educate them about the whats n hows of the game
        -> Need to think about a legal interface for this to happen
            (we can't be RTI-ing everything?).
        -> Getting data in a standardised format from the govt. versus
        getting raw data (in any format) but processing it into a
        standard format.
        -> Creating incentives for them to help us here

    - As a starting point, we should start sharing data between
      government institutions.

    - A portal for already available RTI data

    - Countries which have achieved the above points to some level,
      helps our bureaucrats to take decisions.

    - Specific areas we need to focus on here?

3. Community

    - Focus on getting people with different backgrounds to work
      together on a problem statement.

    - Organisation
        -> Structure of the community (classification for
           websites/mailing lists etc.)

    - Community involvement
        -> Asking people about common issues like difficulties in
           getting data

    - There is a need for a common and open framework for accessing (all
      kinds of) data.
        - Data standards
            -> Have a metadata for a data source/series giving us it's
               definition.
            -> Framework should be well thought and designed in a way so
               as to withstand any type of future inclusion.

        - Data authenticity (example, same data set from different sources)
            -> Do we trust the data source?
            -> How do we keep a sanity check?

4. Objective for doing all this

These thoughts are just out of our heads, need more refining. Please
give your inputs regarding what should be (or not) covered in the
meetup.

We are thinking of the meetup date in late May/early June. As for the
venue, NIPFP (http://www.nipfp.org.in/) is ready to host us.

Guys, please add anything which I may have missed out.

Thanks.

now coming to the dates and the meeting agenda , we can have a consensus right here in this thread as to what we are going to talk/discuss in the coming meeting , i do not mind as simple an agenda like getting all the stake holders on a common platform to discuss issues and ways to tackle them it can be both technical and non technical in nature.

My interests are pertaining to Agriculture. I see some data on production stats from the Ministry of Agriculture website <http://agricoop.nic.in/Agristatistics.htm> and also see some data on Agricultural Research at IASRI web <http://www.iasri.res.in/agridata/11data/HOME_11.HTML>
Likewise there is some data which is not shared like the Cultivars/Varieties growing in various locations/area/production etc. There is no primary data about it but with the data of sales and other promotions they arrive at how the varieties are growing in various locations.
I wish that some of us should also work for collection, collation and visualization of data pertaining to agriculture research, production and how they are performing and how the varieties are growing (mean whether they are using the same varieties/crops in all the seasons or changing etc). 
I am sending this email to few of my contacts/friends in Delhi who may join us and work for  opening up of data and visualization of the same for the policy decisions.

* New and interesting ways to look at census 2011 data  - a lot of the data which gets disseminated is on the more well-known parameters .e.g sex ratio or literacy. But there is a wealth of information in census data, down to sub-district level which covers a much wider canvas. analysis/visualisation of this data could throw up a lot of interesting insights.

Your idea looks good to me, and I think we can definitely work out a
plan for doing it. The RDF option to seems feasible, but we'll any
ways explore some other technologies which are present. But as
Satyakam said, if you already have something, we can definitely make
use of that.

But it is very encouraging and exhilarating to note that an entire community is devoted to scraping/sharing and hosting data for all to research/work upon.

I'm in the US on vaca and got sidetracked.So Bangalore DataMeet met on the 25th of April at the Thoughworks offices. Thank you to Thoughtworks for providing the fantastic space!
We started off by summing up Open DataCamp and talking about upcoming events. We then started to discuss big issues in data. With the goal of focusing on a few issues in order to really go after it. 
A good list was made (Sorry I don't have it with me but will update the group when I get back)We also discussed what data we want and a lot of things transportation related came up. Also the potential to work with corporates on their data. 
Also I asked the group. ""What should be our project?""  The big example in the US is weather data and how when the government opened it up it created a new industry and really showed the potential of open data and what should or will be the Indian example used.
It was suggested transportation specifically railroad data. Sorry these notes are not more detailed...I will ask others who were at the meeting to add big points. 
My thoughts:I think transportation is something that would be interesting as a group for us to work on. And we can create several different projects there is also a lot of interest in general not just railroads but buses. I think it would be interesting if we picked a saturday and maybe road a bus and plotted all the stops on a map and what time it got to each stop. Work on an RTI to get the data. Someone mentioned Mithila, who works at BMTC, before she could be someone we can talk to about getting access to data. 
Anyway I think for the Bangalore group working on transportation data would be an interesting starting point. What do you all think?-- Nisha Thompson

 A quick summary of our project:
 BigMash is conceived as a data platform, where we will collect data from credible sources, and then process them into various formats for further spreading, analysis and visualization. 
 We propose to share refined data as products to academics for educational use, businesses who need them to boost profits, and individuals who are interested in mashing up data.  We also provide services like online mash-up tool and sharing and trading system for a very nominal fee…
 Together they will let users to create their own reports and redefined data, and share them to others who may also need them. Our goal is to build a platform on which everyone can access, manipulate clean and ready-to-go data in order to improve the quality of their lives. 
 
How are we going about this idea: 
Still early days, we are on the opportunity analysis phase, where we are attempting to validate our hypothesis about our value proposition.
 
How you can help: 
We would request you to participate in a initial survey and help us gain more information about our potential customers. Please feel free to share your experience and thoughts on the same…

Have been trying stuff out with D3 and learning a lot of javascript
etc. Â as well, and my first experiment is plotting the daily moves for
the NSE Nifty and BankNifty (I can extend this to as many stocks or
indexes as I want)

http://capitalmind.in/testniftyviz/

It's an SVG thingy so you can't use IE. No optimizations or
minification or gzipping yet (I'm learning yet)

Since it's an experiment (I've just thulped it on the blog, so excuse
all the formatting) and a copy from a D3 sample, I'd like to ask for
feedback. Specifically;

1) It's an interesting viz for traders - tells you why stocks are dead
(look at the lack of colour since 2010). But it doesn't provide much
useful information other than a broad picture, i.e. you can't use it
to trade or such. I wonder if there's a use for this kind of viz in
the financial markets?

2) I do a monthly post on the last day of each month with a static
excel chart, like this
http://capitalmind.in/2012/05/may-sees-the-biggest-monthly-fall-in-2012/
. But dos the above viz sound like a better way?

3) SVG seems to be slow on Firefox for me and doesn't work on the
default browser on the Android, or in IE it seems. Any thoughts about
what to use if not SVG (Canvas?) or how to gracefully degrade?

Thanks,

Deepak

This is a great visualisation. But for it to be more 'actionable'
'from an investor's point of view, i was wondering whether it might
not be better to produce heat map that shows returns across sectors.

In fact, your nifty monthly returns map points the way...you could
have a matrix where the horizontal axis represents time, and the
vertical axis are different sectors - auto, IT, fmcg etc...in fact you
could use the sector specific bse and nse indices as well. The x,y
coordinate of the two could then be the monthly returns for that
sector in that specific month...colour coded of course.

Such a map would instantly tell me which sectors are doing well
currently and which are not. If i am a momentum investor i would look
at those sectors which have done well in recent months.if i am a value
investor i would look at sectors which have been out of favour and
where there might be bargains to be picked out.

mouseover/hover label to simply. It is useful in that strength and
weakness are immediately highlighted as top/bottoms whereas in a
linear heatmap you can't identify areas (since each tick in the Y axis
would be a sector, you can't see an ""area"" of outperformance, as each
line is different).

One simple strategy is to go long those that are at the top and to go
short those at the bottom, and to see how that would have done in the
past - i.e haev trends sustained, what kind of time period etc. and
perhaps plot that outlier analysis (like the time series of a 1/2 SD
of relative returns)

So Megha has been working on a set of reports for elected
representatives to highlight the state of infrastructure in schools
and pre-schools in their constituencies.

We currently have three versions that differ in how the indicators are
ranked and wanted some feedback on these three methods of ranking,
whether one makes more sense than the others or whether there is an
entirely better way of doing this.

In this version, we have chosen 70% as a cut off for 'good' - so any
indicator that is above 70% is green and below 70% is red. There is no
real basis for 70%. It could be 50% or 60% or any other number too:

http://beta.klp.org.in:8018/charts/1/245/2/3

In this version, the colour coding in the band indicates which quarter
(0-25,25-50,50-75,75-100) on a percentage scale, the score for a
particular indicator lies in. It's not much different from the
previous one but is a little more granular and visual, so to speak.

http://beta.klp.org.in:8017/charts/1/245/2/3

This one is slightly different, it compares each indicator against the
average for the entire pool and if it is above the average, is green
and if below, is red. We're not sure if we should use the average or
the median here.

http://beta.klp.org.in:8013/charts/1/245/2/3

Thoughts, feedback and criticism is more than welcome.

Thank you!

The one way it can be done is using Windows and automating IE instead.
Have done that using C#, but yes, it's a painful exercise and NREGA
more so because they constantly validate with VIEWSTATE and other
hidden parameters.

Having said that, the end result is a bunch of HTML files (for job
cards) which I assume can be obtained using some test framework tools?

Right. Thats the problem. The server side is very sensitive to these values,
and not being asp developer, dont know the logic by which it is generated
or validated.

The approach will eventually look like browser automation of various kinds -
IE or other framework. Phantomjs uses webkit (chrome/safari engine).
I looked at available test automation frameworks incuding Selenium.
I needed something to run off AWS servers (read: no display; found
xvrb inefficient, hard to use). So chose to go with Phantomjs. Another
advantage I found with it is that all code is in javascript. So it is
cross-platform, compact, and potentially convertible into an

Thats what is going on here. Once we get the html, we can use whatever

Global Governance of the Internet must
                    be Democratised!
 A joint
              statement by civil society organisations
              for the UN CSTD meeting on 'Enhanced Cooperation on Public
              Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet' to take place in
              Geneva on May 18th, 2012
proposed by
              
Focus on the Global
                South (Thailand),
                Instituto Nupef (Brazil), IT for Change (India),  
Knowledge Commons (India), Other News (Italy),
                Third World Network (Malaysia)  
and endorsed
                by 
organisations

                and individuals listed at the end of the statement
The Internet is a
          major force today, restructuring our economic, social,
          political and cultural systems. Most people implicitly assume
          that it is basically a beneficent force, needing, if at all,
          some caution only at the user-end. This may have been true in
          the early stages when the Internet was created and sustained
          by benevolent actors, including academics, technologists, and
          start-up enterprises that challenged big businesses. However,
          we are getting past that stage now. What used to be a public
          network of millions of digital spaces, is now largely a
          conglomeration of a few proprietary spaces. (A few websites
          like Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon together make much
          of what is considered the Internet by most people today.) We
          are also moving away from a browser-centric architecture of
          the 'open' Internet to an applications-driven mobile Internet,
          that is even more closed and ruled by proprietary spaces (like
          App Store and Android Market). In fact, some
            Internet plans for mobiles come only with a few
            big websites and applications, without the open 'public'
            Internet, which is an ominous pointer to what the future
            Internet may look like. What started off
          as a global public resource is well on its way to becoming a
          set of monopoly private enclosures, and a means for
          entrenching dominant power. At this stage,
            it is crucial to actively defend and promote the Internet's
            immense potential as a democratic and egalitarian force,
            including through appropriate principles and policies at the
            global level.
Who governs
                the Internet
It is a myth that
        'the
            Internet is not governed by anyone'. It is also not a
          coincidence nor a natural order of things that the Internet,
          and through it, our future societies, are headed in the way of
          unprecedented private gate-keeping and rentier-ing. The
          architecture of the Internet is being actively shaped today by
          the most powerful forces, both economic and political. A few
          US based companies increasingly have monopoly control over
          most of the Internet. The US government itself controls some
          of the most crucial nodes of the global digital network. Together, these
            two forces, in increasing conjunction, are determining the
            techo-social structure of a new unipolar world. It is important
          for progressive actors to urgently address this situation,
          through seeking globally democratic forms of governance of the
          Internet.  
While the US
          government and US based monopoly Internet companies already
          have a close working relationship to support and further each
          other's power, this relationship is now being formalised
          through new power compacts; whether in the area of
          extra-territorial IP enforcement (read, global economic
          extraction) through legislations like SOPA , or in the area
          of security (read, global extension of coercive power) through
          cyber-security legislations like CIPSA. 
The US government
          has stubbornly refused to democratise the oversight of the
          Internet's root server and domain name system, which it
          controls. While the US pooh-poohs the security concerns
          expressed by other countries vis-a-vis such unacceptable
          unilateralism, rather hypocritically, it seeks to
          contractually obligate the non-profit managing these key
          infrastructures to appoint its security officials only on US
          government advice. (The chief security officer of this
          non-profit body is already, in fact, a sworn member of the
          'Homeland Security Advisory Council' of the US!)
Apart from the
          direct application of US law and whims (think Wikileaks) over the global
          Internet, and Internet-based social activity (increasingly a
          large part of our social existence), default global law is
          also being written by the clubs of powerful countries that
          routinely draft Internet policies and policy frameworks today.
        The OECD and
            Council of Europe are two active sites of such policy
            making,
          covering areas like cyber-security, Internet intermediary
          liability, search engines, social networking sites etc. Last
          year, OECD came out with its 'Principles
                  for Internet Policy-Making'. These Principles,
            heavy on IP enforcement and private policing through large
            North-based Internet companies, are to guide Internet
            policies in all OECD countries. Recently, OECD decided to
            'invite' other, non-OECD, countries to accede to these
            Principles. This
            is the new paradigm of global governance, where the powerful
            countries make the laws and the rest of the world must
            accept and implement them.  
Who is not
                allowed at the governance table
While
            Northern countries are very active at Internet related
            policy- and law-making, which have extra-territorial
            ambition and reach, they strongly
              resist any UN based initiative for development of global
              Internet principles and policies. This is in
              keeping with the increasingly common Northern efforts at
              undermining UN/ multi-lateral frameworks in other global
              governance arenas like trade, IP
            etc. For instance; trying to keep global financial systems
            out of UNCTAD's purview at the recent Doha UNCTAD meeting, and bringing
            in Anti-Counterfeiting Trade
          Agreement (ACTA)
            as a new instrument of extra-territorial IP enforcement by
            the OECD, bypassing WIPO.  
The mandate of the
          World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) for building a
          globally democratic space for developing Internet related
          global policies is quite clear. The WSIS outcome
                  document states that, “the process
              towards enhanced cooperation (on Internet-related
              international public policies), (is) to be started by the
              UN Secretary-General ... by the end of the first quarter
              of 2006”. However, six years
          down the line, developed countries do not seem to be willing
          to even formally discuss how to operationalise this very
          important WSIS mandate of 'enhanced cooperation', much less do
          something concrete about it.  
OUR DEMAND -
                Internet Governance must be democratised
We, the
            undersigned civil society organisations, affirm that the
            Internet must be governed democratically, with the equal
          involvement of all people, groups and countries. Its
          governance systems must be open, transparent and inclusive,
          with civil society given adequate avenues of meaningful
          substantive participation. While we denounce statist control
          over the Internet sought by many governments at national
          levels, we believe that the struggle at the global level also
          has significant dynamics of a different kind. Our demands with
            respect to 'global' Internet Governance espouse a simple and
            obvious democratic logic. On the technical
          governance side, the oversight of the Internet's critical
          technical and logical infrastructure, at present with the US
          government, should be transferred to an appropriate,
          democratic and participative, multi-lateral body, without
          disturbing the existing distributed architecture of technical
          governance of the Internet in any significant way. (However,
          improvements in the technical governance systems are certainly
          needed.) On the side of larger Internet related public
          policy-making on global social, economic, cultural and
          political issues, the OECD-based model of global policy
          making, as well as the default application of US laws, should
          be replaced by a new UN-based democratic mechanism. Any such
          new arrangement should be based on the principle of
          subsidiarity, and be innovative in terms of its mandate,
          structure, and functions, to be adequate to the unique
          requirements of global Internet governance. It must be fully
          participative of all stakeholders, promoting the democratic
          and innovative potential of the Internet.  
The Internet
            should be governed on the principles of human liberty,
            equality and fraternity. It should be based on the accepted
            principle of the indivisibility of human rights; civil, political,
          economic, social and cultural rights, and also people's
          collective right to development. A rights-based
            agenda should be developed as an alternative to the current
            neo-liberal model driving the development of the Internet, and the evolution
          of an information society. The UN is the appropriate place for
          developing and implementing such an alternative agenda.
          Expedient labelling by the most powerful forces in the
          Internet arena, of the UN, and of developing countries, as
          being interested only in 'controlling
          the Internet', and under this cover, continually shaping the
          architecture of the Internet and its social paradigm to
          further their narrow interests, is a bluff that must be
          called.
We
          demand that a Working Group of the UN Commission on Science
            and Technology for Development (CSTD) be instituted to
            explore possible ways of implementing 'enhanced cooperation'
            for global Internet-related policies. (Such a CSTD
          Working Group is also being sought by some developing
          countries.) 'Enhanced cooperation' must be implemented through
          innovative multi-lateral mechanisms, that are participatory.
          Internet policy-making cannot be allowed to remain the
          preserve of one country or clubs of rich countries. If the Internet
            is to promote democracy in the world, which
          incidentally is the much touted agenda of the US and other
          Northern countries, the Internet
            itself has, first, to be governed democratically.

Vivek and Amith will be speaking about the Awesome Contracts Project.Contracts are ubiquitous in our everyday life. They are also a nuisance. And they typically come attached with a bigger nuisance - lawyers!
Interestingly though, contracts are a lot like code. Geek-lawyers, a very small, minuscule tribe on this planet, tend to notice a lot of similarities between the two. If this is true, it opens up a lot of possibilities, including changing the way we do business and in particular generate contracts, negotiate and seal deals.
We'll talk about some of the technology and some of the products we're working on that we think can provide power to a lot of folks.Time: 5 PM - 7 PMWe also welcome lightening talks, of 5 minutes duration, before the lecture, presenting interesting work that any member of the audience would like to introduce the others to.

 Bangalore DataMeet Two weeks ago
Vikas Mishra <vikvik...@gmail.com> May 09 12:01PM +0530  Yeah that's a good area to start with, BMTC has plenty of data which when
exposed via open api can create immense value and can give a new dimensionto Geo-location based real time apps. Some time back, a friend of mine was working on a mobile app for thevisually impaired which would navigate them to their destination
irrespective of which bus they took (shortest multiple break journeys) butcouldn't proceed due to lack of proper exposed api.   -- Thanks & Regards, Vikas Mishra http://in.linkedin.com/in/vikasmishra007
 
Neha M <nehamu...@gmail.com> May 09 06:02PM +0530  I wasn't there, but yes for working with BMTC data. The riding a bus and plotting could happen independently? Unless the idea
was of it being like a ""mapping party"" , in which case, gathering data forall teh buses will be a long-term plan :-) That said, there are already a couple of very good and fairly reliableprojects (like Narasimha Datta's<http://narasimhadatta.info/bmtc_query.html>).
Maybe we should consider what extra value the project would add toexisting information. Cheers,Neha  -- Neha Mujumdar
 
Nisha Thompson <nisha.t...@gmail.com> May 09 08:48AM -0400  I wasn't thinking that the bus plotting project would all the buses but to
pick maybe one or two that people take and see how the stops compare andsee if we can get a good idea of some timings. But you are absolutely right about seeing what extra value we can add toprojects that already exist.

Import-Export data of various items could probably help reduce information asymmetry & help in determining and planning capacities of different products.I have subscribed to a couple of services which provide port wise imports of different chemicals. However, the information there isn't comprehensive & a lot is missed out in that data in addition to the data being quite expensive.
I want to know whether there is any organization which provides the import - export trade data that is comprehensive like any government approved organization. Also, want to know whether anyone is aware of any open source of data for trade through Indian ports.

You can get it at http://commerce.nic.in/eidb/default.asp. This goes
upto 4 letter code detail, but it needs serious work in terms of
scraping/downloads.

This is usually outdated by 6 months or so. DGCIS Kolkata provides
more recent data at a cost.
http://www.dgciskol.nic.in/

Ports authority may be able to provide port-level summary data (I've
seen large level aggregates at various port sites too).

Also, product level data is tough to get by. I also contacted Nhava Sheva port for the data but it seems they are not interested in sharing the data for free. 
So, the only way to get data is to take a subscription from data providers.Out of the different sources tried, I think Online Telecom Network Services, Mumbai is the most reliable in terms of comprehensiveness of the data (Still it is not complete). In addition, one can try subscribing to data offered by India Infodrive, Kolkotta. However, the service levels there are pathetic and we get data with a lag of more than a month.
Does anyone know of any other paid service?Regards,Purav Shah"

3870,anant maringanti,#topic/datameet/s15WnOw651c,1,2012-04-27 22:21:00,on the preliminary Hyderabad meetup....,"A quick update on the preliminary Hyderabad opendata meetup yesterday
at lamakaan.

It was a small meeting with five of us -Shanmugam, Rakesh, Jagadeesh,
Subhash, Ganes and me but it was a diverse group - one agricultural
scientist, Â one RTI activist, one journalist, two IT professionals and
one urban geographer,

Some of the themes that surfaced from the freewheeling conversation
might find resonance with others.

1. Data cultures: One of the biggest challenges faced by RTI activists
as well as data visualizers is the format of data. The RTI act does
not explicitly say that we can ask for information in a particular
format. Given that a lot of the data processing in government agencies
is outsourced and data entry operators and even many of the government
officers are not proficient with different formats, we often end up
with data formats that are not easily portable. Most often information
and data is given in hard copies. Even when it is given in soft copy,
it is not easy to work with. (PDF files of excel spreadsheet !!!).
There is a need to do some concerted work here both at the level of
policy advocacy and at the level of training and overcoming inertia
and reluctance to share information and data in usable formats. This
seems to resonate with the threads on bus routes data on this list.
Zainab may have more to say about this - because this friction -
against data portability is not just inertia but an artifact of
political cultures.

2. Activist networks and social movements generate tremendous amounts
of data in the course of their work. These data reveal spatial and
temporal patterns which can lead to useful insights. It is important
to take up some demonstrative projects in Hyderabad which can build
confidence and build new data savyness among activists. (Somewhat like
Transparent chennai, KLP etc.). May be should think of how to develop
effective interfaces that can facilitate a richer interaction between
data professionals and potential users of data.

3. Collaborations between data and IT professionals and activist / NGO
groups and social scientists can potentially lead to deepening of data
awareness which can create both market opportunities as well as the
emergence of new socio-political agendas but it takes careful, patient
and sustained work. (Clearly there are no formulae for this, we just
have to go ahead and see how it shapes up. This meeting may itself be
a starting point for something like that In Hyderabad)

We should encourage more people to join in the conversation both in
the larger pool of data initiatives but also at the regional - city
level. Over the next few weeks, we will work towards crafting some
doable projects in Hyderabad so that we can think more concretely as
we go along.


Ganes, please add if I have missed anything...

let me see what comes of it. i think the best way to do this is to write a few brief articles - blog posts and circulate them. then call for a small meeting over a weekend. and then take it from there. i can do this by early next week.
let us chat on phone some time. my mobile number is 9618251776. also, btw, K S Rajan, associate prof at IIIT has been working on opendata, open gis kind of projects for many years. he and his students have actually developed a crowdsourcing platform and some mobile apps for the same. 
i will speak to him and get him into the loop. In general, in my view, it is important to draw potential users / clients of open data into the conversation at this stage.

 Hey Everyone, 
Now that Open DataCamp it is up to us to keep the momentum going. So let's start with the Bangalore Meet up and have a DataMeet the last week of April. Some things to discuss.
 Learnings from the event, next steps, and what we can focus on in Bangalore. 
 I will suggest also that people interested in having an Open DataCamp in their city start by having a small datameet this month or next. That way the people based locally will be at a better place to plan.
 I think the people in Hyderabad will benefit the most from starting with a small meetup and then they can plan the event for June. 
 Let's aim for the Bangalore Meeting to be on April 25th. I will get back to you with a time and place. 
 Anyway who wants to start a local meet in their city reply to this mail and we can brainstorm ways to get it started.

I got sufficiently upset to write a blog post about it (http://
www.bzst.com/2012/04/world-is-flat-only-for-us-students.html). I also
talked to Tableau, but they said they are bounded by ""legal
constraints"". A chap from the UK fought the war more successfully and
was able to get UK to be a legal participating country (they updated
the legal doc). If anyone knows how to battle the same for India that
would be terrific! Figuring out the legal issues would also serve for
future contests. I am glad to share my emailing with Tableau on this
for those interested.

Narayanaswamy, former Member of Parliament* V.R. Sudarshan, Member of Legislative Council, Karnataka (Congress)* Na. Vijayshankar, Cyber Law College* Mahesh Murthy, Pinstorm* B.G. Mahesh, OneIndia.in* Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Centre for Law and Policy Research* Siddharth Narain, Alternative Law Forum* Ram Bhat, Maraa## Immediate BackgroundMember of Parliament, P. Rajeeve has introduced a motion in the RajyaSabha calling for the Internet censorship law passed last year(""Intermediary Guidelines Rules"") to be annulled.  This motion will betaken up once the Budget Session 2012 reconvenes, and will need thesupport of the majority of both Houses to be passed.  Apart from this,we have seen multiple cases in the past few months of flagrant abuse ofthe speech laws, especially the Information Technology Act, includingthe removal of CartoonsAgainstCorruption.com, the arrest of M. Karthik,a 20-year-old atheist from Hyderabad, and of Prof. Ambikesh Mahapatrafrom Kolkata for 'defamatory' cartoons of Mamata Banerjee, both unders.66A of the Information Technology Act.  We need to develop strategiesto combat this over-eagerness by authorities to abuse speech laws.## More Detailed BackgroundInternet censorship has been in India ever since VSNL brought internetconnectivity to Indians in the mid-1990s, when websites were blockedthrough executive fiat.  In 2000 the Information Technology Act waspassed, and while it had a provision on electronic publication ofobscene materials, it did not contain any provisions for blocking ofwebsites.  Still, Rules were made under the Act under which thegovernment blocked numerous websites.In 2008 the Act was amended, bringing more transparency to thecensorship regime.  Unfortunately, cases like theCartoonsAgainstCorruption.com and the disparity between censorshipstatistics published by Google and the official statistics revealedunder RTI by the Department of Information Technology show a largeamount of extra-legal censorship happening.In February 2011, the DIT published draft rules that were severelycriticised by many MPs, including Rajeev Chandrashekar, P. Rajeeve,Mahendra Mohan, and Kumar Deepak Das, organizations including CIS,Software Freedom Law Centre, IAMAI, and companies like Google India.Many MPs, including Rajeev Chandrashekar and P. Rajeeve, raised concernsabout the draft.  In April 2011 disregarding all these concerns, thegovernment pressed ahead with the Rules.  These rules allowed any personto get content removed from the Internet by writing to any'intermediary' (like Rediff, BSNL, Google, Facebook, etc.) within 36hours, with no questions asked, and no intimation to the content owner(hence no question of challenge), and once again made internetcensorship as unaccountable as it was pre-2008, only with the power tocensor in the hands of every citizen, rather than just a few governmentofficials.In May 2011, due to the backlash in the media, with negative editorialsin prominent newspapers, Mr. Kapil Sibal indicated in an interview thatthe rules would be revisited.  From August 2011 onwards there was acrackdown on several web companies, including Indiatimes, Google, Yahoo,Microsoft, and Facebook, with the government asking them to proactivelymonitor online content and remove what it deemed objectionable material. Since then, a number of egregious cases of censorship through filing ofintimidatory FIRs and lawsuits have been happening.## OrganisersThe Foundation for Media Professionals is an independent, not-for-profitorganisation, set up in April 2008, by a group of Indian journalistswith diverse media backgrounds and work experiences. Though we aretraditionally referred to as journalists, we have decided to callourselves differently to emphasise the importance we place onprofessionalism, so that we can be true to our vocation as watchdogs ofsociety.The Centre for Internet and Society was registered as a society inBangalore in 2008. As an independent, non-profit research organisation,it conducts research on topics such as Accessibility, Access toKnowledge, Openness, Internet Governance, Telecom, Digital Natives andDigital Humanities.Regards,Pranesh"

open data). The local train data is almost complete. While BMTC data is 
unfinished. I am occassionally updating from published BMTC timetable book.

Are you trying to create a GTFS (General/Google Transit Feed Spec) for 
Bangalore transport?
 
If so we should talk more, we in Mumbai have been engaged in this same 
challenge with the BEST database, in our project called ChaloBEST. See 
our wiki for more information http://wiki.chalobest.in
 
We're interested in GTFS not so much because we want to share our work 
with Google, but since GTFS is an open data standard around which we can 
converge our software development.
 
We are building apps and services for serving transit data on the web, 
over SMS, in an Android app, and in print, in English and Indic scripts. 
Mumbai is our use case, but the apps should work with anyone anywhere 
who has a valid GTFS feed.
 
ChaloBEST officially works with the cool kids at BusRoutes.in 
http://busroutes.in who are trying to scratch the same itches in Delhi 
and Chennai. Let's join forces and learn more from each other.
 
See my ten-minute talk on ChaloBEST at the India Urban Conference, where 
we won the first prize in the Sankranti Transform Urban India 
competition Chalo BEST

in India, with an international cadre of researchers who are developing

the latest tools for collecting and managing data. Our goals are to

identify new research directions, to disseminate the latest technologies

from the lab to the field, and to forge new long-term collaborations

that are beneficial to both researchers and practitioners.



The workshop program will feature:

- short (10-minute) talks by leaders in the field

- a demo/poster session of tools for data collection

- open working sessions to discuss key problems in the domain

Both written from a particular stand point vis a vis data for research, policy, implementation and mobilized publics in urban settings in India.  1 ) One tank@atime: experimenting with open data in an urban context
The amount of literature produced by academic and NGO researchres and 
lawyers on tanks in cities is not insignificant by any measure. 
Acknowledging the importance of all that work, we still want to insist 
that contemporary urban change in India needs a different approach to 
knowledge production.  Our starting point is that we need a platform for
 capturing, sharing and interpreting knowledge that can enable new urban
 actors. And we are wondering if there is promise in the new energy that
 is gathering up around open data initiatives everywhere in recent 
years.  Is it possible that there is in fact something here that web 
developers, data analysts, data visualizers, social and physical 
scientists from all sorts of disciplines as well as politicians and 
civil servants  and ordinary people who live by, walk by, and work by 
the tanks – can do together.  Is there a promise of a new public sphere 
lurking behind Open Data Initiatives ? We suspect we will not know the 
answer until we actually do it and see for ourselves.More here:http://www.onecityatatime.net/?p=552) One landfill@ a time: Who is afraid of open data?

Can we figure out how to set up Open Data Standards that respond to 
collective needs for knowledge rather than for individual access to data
 ? How can we set up a dialogue among people who handle data and may 
have very different takes arising from their unique vantage points ? We 
are willing to wager that we can. But before we do that, let us place a 
caveat. The current push for open data is actually selectively directed 
at certain parts of the state. This is not surprising. Government 
agencies collect an incredible amount of data on an ongoing basis. Some 
of this data holds economic intelligence, and some of it holds security 
intelligence.  A lot of it can be re-crafted and delivered in forms that
 can potentially reduce transaction costs. Corporations also accumulate 
tremendous amounts of fine-grained data.  Mobile phone and internet 
service providers are capable of tracking every single move you make 
when you are carrying the devices.  Even if we apply the most stringent 
privacy laws, the anonymized, aggregate data that these service 
providers are collecting on a daily basis can be used to better plan and
 regulate our cities. Even with the asymmetry in the current charge at 
openness (seriously, howmany of us have pushed for open access to the 
data that corporations gather for public purposes?); a lot could still 
be done. It will not happen by itself. The original impulse for Open 
Data is clearly coming from a techno-entreprenuerial-managerial actors. 
But then, technology always has spillovers which can lead to some very 
surprising consequences. And that is why we can afford to be optimistic.More: http://www.onecityatatime.net/?p=88anant

Anant,I really agree that we should start writing up some of the reason for open data in India and doing a better job in general of communicating to others about why being open with data is beneficial.  Maybe that should be one output that this group can accomplish in the next few months.
Nothing formal just a short blogpost on your personal or organizations blogs that we can start collate. Nisha

Hi Ganes, I am meeting with a few people tomorrow who might be interested in an open data project. they are not clued into the idea of opendata but they have a need for data and are potentially capable of handling data - a group of commuters in hitech city area. 
let me see what comes of it. i think the best way to do this is to write a few brief articles - blog posts and circulate them. then call for a small meeting over a weekend. and then take it from there. i can do this by early next week.
let us chat on phone some time. my mobile number is 9618251776. also, btw, K S Rajan, associate prof at IIIT has been working on opendata, open gis kind of projects for many years. he and his students have actually developed a crowdsourcing platform and some mobile apps for the same. 
i will speak to him and get him into the loop. In general, in my view, it is important to draw potential users / clients of open data into the conversation at this stage.

Anant, good to hear from someone in Hyderabad, most of the people seem to be from other cities! ISB had offered to host the Hyd meet and there were some brief discussions initiated during the last OpenData meet at Bangalore. Reema Gupta of ISB (part of this group too) had tentatively proposed a date of 23rd June for this. It would be good if we can work on identifying other interested people in the city and plan next steps.

 Hey Everyone, 
Now that Open DataCamp it is up to us to keep the momentum going. So let's start with the Bangalore Meet up and have a DataMeet the last week of April. Some things to discuss.
 Learnings from the event, next steps, and what we can focus on in Bangalore. 
 I will suggest also that people interested in having an Open DataCamp in their city start by having a small datameet this month or next. That way the people based locally will be at a better place to plan.
 I think the people in Hyderabad will benefit the most from starting with a small meetup and then they can plan the event for June. 
 Let's aim for the Bangalore Meeting to be on April 25th. I will get back to you with a time and place. 
 Anyway who wants to start a local meet in their city reply to this mail and we can brainstorm ways to get it started.

months. No progress since then !
In my opinion, our government's energy would be better spent in making
its data open rather than working on a data publishing platform.

So to put it in another way, why should i be fed with only Google maps. Can I have the choice of seeing through OSM as well? This is not very difficult technically with libraries like mapstraction. (The debate of which one to be defaulted can be had later ;) )

 other than

How often google's map change and who changes (approves) them. I don't think map maker community is any bigger than OSM community(which itself is small). Google maps might be the Britannica soon enough when there is sufficient map data & community around it.

We (Localbeat - formerly TaazzaGO at http://www.localbeat.in) have been down this path before. We let our users report citizen issues around them while consuming other information such as news, events, deals on the go. While the initial interest/usage were great, we came to the same stumbling block of closing the loop. While iPaidaBribe is known to be one of the successfully campaigns  IMHO the impact could have been significantly higher than 15K reports across the board.
IMHO, the value of NGO's is helping close the loop on the other side with officials and learn to partner with folks. While they have very capable folks like Thej helping them out, their impact to the ecosystem can be significantly higher if they become the pipe and use their clout to decrease the friction with the official structure.
In our prior experience, we havent seen evidence of such and have been bogged down by branding issues & such.I really like the work the PR legislative is doing with the MP data on their site.

Although I am trained as a geographer I am barely comfortable with the technology and techniques of cartography. The politics of cartography and information is more like my domain. 
So, bear with me if my question sounds naive or uninformed. 
From what I can make out, there are two responses in this thread both dealing with the effectiveness of these new interactive platforms. And both speak of the feedback loop being closed as the critical gap. In both it seems to me that the role of the NGO remains the same: the NGO makes it possible to close the loop between the citizen-subjects and the bureaucracy. In other words the NGO is the arbitrator between two parties that are not able to speak to each other. (That is probably the basis for the branding battles - two NGOs competing with each other for that role of being the sole arbitrator.) 
But couldn't there be other roles possible for the NGO or whatever agency it might be that hosts the platform ? Say for example, enabling a community of users to interpret spatial patterns to develop new action agendas and action repertoirs ?  
I ask this because I have been watching with growing anxiety at all the new data platforms and I have interacted with some of the people who have created them.There seem to be so many of them in the pipeline everywhere. promoted by government-government and government-NGO 
and government-corporation initiatives to throw open the flood gates of 
data. Branding and ownership do seem to be important issues in many of them. My anxiety stems from the fact that as it happens in RTI campaigns - unless the platforms are developed with a political vision and the platforms are developed to generate new insights - one could end up with some useful data access and portability and a lot of junk data. 
For example, what happens if we figure out how to use ward level mapping exercises to make sense of tax incentive funds and see how infrastructural risks are distributed across the city as it gets increasingly financialized ? 
Or if we can figure out how tanks and tank beds and the inflows and outflows into them are changing leading to chronic flooding and public health risks without significantly improving the structural features of housing access to  the urban poor ? And build on that to push for new planning and regulating instruments that strengthen the claims of the katcha abadis ? 
Can someone point me to any  experiences of how these new platforms have led to  possibilities of the above kind in any field because I am really keen on learning how to build a network of such platforms ??anant

I will write an email to you later. Nisha, sharing platforms sounds good. Although I am not quite sure what exactly you mean by that. Allow others to use an existing platform ? Share the technology and help others build their own because there is no reason to replicate the developmental effort each time ? Either way, it sounds like a good idea. 
I think the main thing however, is the challenge of figuring out what sorts of questions to ask, what kinds of insights to look for etc. This would depend on a) the specificity of the city / place etc b) the kind of data that one is looking at or is able to generate c) the kind of politics that the local groups are pursuing d). the group having the ability to ask interesting and useful questions that can be realistically answered and visually represented. 
To illustrate, when I looked at klp.org.in the first thing that struck me is that - so much of the school education politics in Hyderabad revolves around land. Government schools  have been under tremendous pressure to shut down, to club with each other to run shift schools etc. And at least some of this pressure has had to do with the fact that government schools own land. So, over the years we have seen a gradual decline in school performance so much so that closing them down begins to look like the only sensible thing to do. And all this happens against the backdrop of research findings by the Cato institute etc. to show that the poor prefer private schools because they are more ubiquitous and more accountable. In this context, what can one do with a platform like klp.org.in  ??
I think conversations of that kind will really be very helpful to foster a data and tech savyness with vision and also facilitate a sort of directed play with data will become possible. And simultaneously also democratize knowledge production in some real sense. ??

Back to the question answer platform impact question. This is what I struggle with on the data project for India Water Portal. The questions people have -  we don't have data to explore and the data we have leave a lot to be desired.  So it might be an interesting exercise to just gather questions and see what collectively we can answer on whatever platforms and already exists. 
I'm really fascinated by your example regarding gov school performance and land grabbing. What data do we need to answer this question? What exists? Can data even really answer this?
At what point did school performance start going down? Can we match it with economic indicators? Can we add a infrastructure and sanitation layer to it? And Budget? This is when things start to get interesting.

3957,Maya Indira Ganesh,#topic/datameet/wFu4oS1xRsM,22,2012-04-13 04:56:00,Re: [datameet] I Change My City,"AnantThanks for your valuable comments. This is the kind of thing I'm personally interested in and trying to do through some projects at Tactical Tech.I think what you're talking about is really key and is part of the loop we aren't closing. 
On the one hand there is the really basic need to aggregate information towards a kind of accountability that is based on  an input-output sort of model. THen there is the approach that reflects on an issue sideways. And this is where I think the real storytelling or creativity or play, as you put it, with data comes in. What you're saying about land acquisition and school closures is interesting, that there is perhaps a larger story there that needs to be investigated/exposed, perhaps through some creative triangulation. Maybe by looking at patterns of what happens to public institutions on prime land over a period of time in a particular area and that the issue is not about a bias against educational institutions, or a lack of government engagement with education but is about something else entirely. So an advocacy strategy that pushes for education reform ends up being quite narrow if it is just about the right to education. Evidence can be useful in showing that the issue is about the interplay of other powerful factors in the delivery of public services, and then this becomes a platform for advocacy. 
We discovered something similar in a project we're doing with sex wokers in Calcutta and Phnom Penh. The Calcutta group set out to document violence and rights abuses against sex workers but couldn't seem to understand the role of violence by local gangs and hired thugs until they realised that brothels are located on prime land. They used to be on the outskirts of the city but are not quite central and are being eyed by developers very keenly. So there are many kinds of intimidation and distinct patterns of eviction/relocation at play. The issue is then not necessarily of moral objections to sex work in an area but to the fact that they're sitting on prime land (and have been for 150 years). SO the challenge then was to actually look at land ownership, land sale, and the change in ownership patterns in particular areas, what has been acquired/built in a paticular area around a brothel that drives prices up and makes it difficult for the urban poor (people forget that sex workers are also part of the urban poor and the urban underclass) to survive there, forcing them to move? Thugs and gangs end up then playing a small role when you see them as extensions of the land mafia. It also becomes easier/different when you make a case for advocacy around sex worker rights, which is already so loaded and appropriated. IT becomes an issue of land grabbing an about evictions rather than a struggle around moralities. 
The tragedy was the the NGO we're working with had absolutely no capacity to do this kind of playing with evidence and constructing stories that are larger. The point of the project though was to help them gain this capacity and do creative things with data, rather than just produce some boring sixty page report (or yet another interactive map) of where violence happens.

I think the distinction you seem to suggest between two different types of data work is important. We need to find devices to keep the two separate and noise levels low because they need very different approaches. Actually, I would go so far as to say that it will be really useful if we can come up with a sort of glossary for our own clarity. Also, I think it will be useful to write up notes on what it takes to make data related initiatives actually work. I mean what does it take for a durable local network/platform to be established ? How does one explain the actual workings of these networks ? For example, it would be very interesting to pin down different ways of explaining the fact of the Kolkata NGO not having the capacity ?   I mean, how you explain it has consequences for where you go from there, wont it?
Nisha: To be honest, I made up that schools and land issue on the fly. I do not mean that I lied, but that it is a hunch.

Then there are people doing research on education. Each time, I meet anyone of them, I drool. I think, oh my god. Each of these guys is a walking GPS unit. If I can just sit them down and extract data from them and put it onto a map, I can tell somany stories about the world. But of course, it just doesnt happen like that. Each of them also has a bunch of stories. Each of them is directed by a powerful script and each of them also wants to write a small new script. 
So, to answer ""what kind of data do we need and can data even answer the question"", I think it is definitely worth exploring what the officially available data can reveal. I think the sanitation and other infrastrucures layers can reveal a bunch of other stuff about schools and no somuch about the land. But let that be for now... 
I think it is also requires generating new data and as Maya suggests it needs some sort of creative triangulation. Ultimately, this sort of work is both about gaining insights and about collective framings. (In Maya's case, if the local group has stakes in representing it only as a moral issue around women's bodies, then the fact that it also has to do with caste, land price, AIDS prevention funds etc. will tend to remain concealed. Then, what needs to be done is to look for chinks in the story that is visible and see what that reveals). 
I would love to hear more about what you are struggling with in India water portal's data project. I have some ideas on how to work collectively to address the way we think about data, questions and answerabilities of questions and so on. This is definitely a very important issue for my work in Hyderabad where we have recently launched an initiative - Right to the City Foundation and under that Hyderabad Urban Laboratory. 
Finally, Maya, on that Kolkata story - something similar happened in Hyderabad in 1998 but with a further twist.The real estate spike coincided with a shift in international funding priorities from child labor eradication to AIDS prevention triggering all sorts of scrambles in the governmental and non governmental agencies. This meant that the attacks on the women  came in the garb of rescue and rehabilitation packages and branding of select women as AIDS patients etc. Those who did not accept the deal  or were just not considered valuable enough for rescue operations were assaulted by other means. It makes me tremble even now as I recall the details. Harsh Mander documented some slices of the story in his book Unheard voices (he did not make the connections as starkly as I am making). I look forward to seeing how your intervention there has shaped up / is shaping up.

AnantThanks for your valuable comments. This is the kind of thing I'm personally interested in and trying to do through some projects at Tactical Tech.I think what you're talking about is really key and is part of the loop we aren't closing. 







On the one hand there is the really basic need to aggregate information towards a kind of accountability that is based on  an input-output sort of model. THen there is the approach that reflects on an issue sideways. And this is where I think the real storytelling or creativity or play, as you put it, with data comes in. What you're saying about land acquisition and school closures is interesting, that there is perhaps a larger story there that needs to be investigated/exposed, perhaps through some creative triangulation. Maybe by looking at patterns of what happens to public institutions on prime land over a period of time in a particular area and that the issue is not about a bias against educational institutions, or a lack of government engagement with education but is about something else entirely. So an advocacy strategy that pushes for education reform ends up being quite narrow if it is just about the right to education. Evidence can be useful in showing that the issue is about the interplay of other powerful factors in the delivery of public services, and then this becomes a platform for advocacy. 
We discovered something similar in a project we're doing with sex wokers in Calcutta and Phnom Penh. The Calcutta group set out to document violence and rights abuses against sex workers but couldn't seem to understand the role of violence by local gangs and hired thugs until they realised that brothels are located on prime land. They used to be on the outskirts of the city but are not quite central and are being eyed by developers very keenly. So there are many kinds of intimidation and distinct patterns of eviction/relocation at play. The issue is then not necessarily of moral objections to sex work in an area but to the fact that they're sitting on prime land (and have been for 150 years). SO the challenge then was to actually look at land ownership, land sale, and the change in ownership patterns in particular areas, what has been acquired/built in a paticular area around a brothel that drives prices up and makes it difficult for the urban poor (people forget that sex workers are also part of the urban poor and the urban underclass) to survive there, forcing them to move? Thugs and gangs end up then playing a small role when you see them as extensions of the land mafia. It also becomes easier/different when you make a case for advocacy around sex worker rights, which is already so loaded and appropriated. IT becomes an issue of land grabbing an about evictions rather than a struggle around moralities. 
The tragedy was the the NGO we're working with had absolutely no capacity to do this kind of playing with evidence and constructing stories that are larger. The point of the project though was to help them gain this capacity and do creative things with data, rather than just produce some boring sixty page report (or yet another interactive map) of where violence happens.

Thanks Gautam. I looked at the site and have a bunch of questions. I will write an email to you later. Nisha, sharing platforms sounds good. Although I am not quite sure what exactly you mean by that. Allow others to use an existing platform ? Share the technology and help others build their own because there is no reason to replicate the developmental effort each time ? Either way, it sounds like a good idea. 
I think the main thing however, is the challenge of figuring out what sorts of questions to ask, what kinds of insights to look for etc. This would depend on a) the specificity of the city / place etc b) the kind of data that one is looking at or is able to generate c) the kind of politics that the local groups are pursuing d). the group having the ability to ask interesting and useful questions that can be realistically answered and visually represented. 
To illustrate, when I looked at klp.org.in the first thing that struck me is that - so much of the school education politics in Hyderabad revolves around land. Government schools  have been under tremendous pressure to shut down, to club with each other to run shift schools etc. And at least some of this pressure has had to do with the fact that government schools own land. So, over the years we have seen a gradual decline in school performance so much so that closing them down begins to look like the only sensible thing to do. And all this happens against the backdrop of research findings by the Cato institute etc. to show that the poor prefer private schools because they are more ubiquitous and more accountable. In this context, what can one do with a platform like klp.org.in  ??
I think conversations of that kind will really be very helpful to foster a data and tech savyness with vision and also facilitate a sort of directed play with data will become possible. And simultaneously also democratize knowledge production in some real sense. ??

Hi all, I have followed this thread with curiosity. Although I am trained as a geographer I am barely comfortable with the technology and techniques of cartography. The politics of cartography and information is more like my domain. 
So, bear with me if my question sounds naive or uninformed. 
From what I can make out, there are two responses in this thread both dealing with the effectiveness of these new interactive platforms. And both speak of the feedback loop being closed as the critical gap. In both it seems to me that the role of the NGO remains the same: the NGO makes it possible to close the loop between the citizen-subjects and the bureaucracy. In other words the NGO is the arbitrator between two parties that are not able to speak to each other. (That is probably the basis for the branding battles - two NGOs competing with each other for that role of being the sole arbitrator.) 
But couldn't there be other roles possible for the NGO or whatever agency it might be that hosts the platform ? Say for example, enabling a community of users to interpret spatial patterns to develop new action agendas and action repertoirs ?  
I ask this because I have been watching with growing anxiety at all the new data platforms and I have interacted with some of the people who have created them.There seem to be so many of them in the pipeline everywhere. promoted by government-government and government-NGO 
and government-corporation initiatives to throw open the flood gates of 
data. Branding and ownership do seem to be important issues in many of them. My anxiety stems from the fact that as it happens in RTI campaigns - unless the platforms are developed with a political vision and the platforms are developed to generate new insights - one could end up with some useful data access and portability and a lot of junk data. 
For example, what happens if we figure out how to use ward level mapping exercises to make sense of tax incentive funds and see how infrastructural risks are distributed across the city as it gets increasingly financialized ? 
Or if we can figure out how tanks and tank beds and the inflows and outflows into them are changing leading to chronic flooding and public health risks without significantly improving the structural features of housing access to  the urban poor ? And build on that to push for new planning and regulating instruments that strengthen the claims of the katcha abadis ? 
Can someone point me to any  experiences of how these new platforms have led to  possibilities of the above kind in any field because I am really keen on learning how to build a network of such platforms ??

Posting on this based on discussions with Gautam on Twitter.Neha, I think you hit the nail on the head. We (Localbeat - formerly TaazzaGO at http://www.localbeat.in) have been down this path before. We let our users report citizen issues around them while consuming other information such as news, events, deals on the go. While the initial interest/usage were great, we came to the same stumbling block of closing the loop. While iPaidaBribe is known to be one of the successfully campaigns  IMHO the impact could have been significantly higher than 15K reports across the board.
IMHO, the value of NGO's is helping close the loop on the other side with officials and learn to partner with folks. While they have very capable folks like Thej helping them out, their impact to the ecosystem can be significantly higher if they become the pipe and use their clout to decrease the friction with the official structure.
In our prior experience, we havent seen evidence of such and have been bogged down by branding issues & such.I really like the work the PR legislative is doing with the MP data on their site.

No info on how the actual complaints will be addressed and by whom. This would be useful if it became more than a platform for venting rage at officials.

So the question, as I see it, is what you, as the end user, should
see? And if you see only OSM you are okay with it? There aren't very
many, and I can't think of any, platforms that allow the end user to
change the base maps, no? If the purpose of the map is to help people

There aren't many applications which allow the user to select the base layer, but that's due to multiple factors.
1. There aren't many applications where map data is viewed at a deeper level(custom tiles). People just use maps for navigation / routing. So there isn't any differentiation between Google maps and OSM.
2. OSM as map data source / community is slowly gaining momentum. It wouldn't have made sense for anyone to ask for OSM layer for Indian maps in 2008, but things are different today.3. May be people(developers) arent aware of these and simply chose Google maps?

Well, I assume they have looked at all of this, right? And that Google
maps, with the free of cost license, worked best for them. I do see
value in OSM but maybe it's not for everyone all the time?
I dont have idea how they worked out, but I dont agree ""OSM is not for everyone all the time"". You seem to sound like Windows Vs Linux, latter having ""extra"" learning curve. As mentioned in previous post, technically it doesn't differ much and takes same time and effort if one uses right libraries. OSM as a data source is much more richer and flexible, that doesn't mean its only suitable for complex requirements and involves extra work. If you just want to show a map with bunch of points, use cloudmade's tiles and get the map.
Another compelling reason why opensource / community projects must use OSM is to avoid lock-in / dependency. Lets not forget Yahoo and AOL have closed their mapping business not so long ago, Google is a listed company after all, stock holders can change its priorities(which I hope was one the reason they started to charge the service) , so its important for the code for these projects be usable without depending upon anyone else! The advantage in using OSM is you can set up your own tileserver with free, opengeodata and be fully self reliant :)

So the question, as I see it, is what you, as the end user, should

1. As of now in ICMC we just display the stuff on the map. We aren't adding anything. So Google and OSM are same for me. My end users are normal people who are not bothered about what is used as long as it works. 
In all practical experiments Gmaps loads faster than OSM for me. So i used it.2. I agree3. Not really. Most developers who work on GiS know what OSM is and what it offers. But they have favorites. Google has been good to me (developer), I love their products and APIs, I use them. Sometimes its as simple as that.
 

Well, I assume they have looked at all of this, right? And that Google
maps, with the free of cost license, worked best for them. I do see
value in OSM but maybe it's not for everyone all the time?

If I think Google is going to close down tomorrow then I will have to ask all those who have gmails to move to self hosting and move this list to mailman,  which I think is impractical.  
But then if they stop the service then I will move on, no big deal.To be fair to the NGO, they are not in the business of technology. They are in the business of serving people. If Gmaps, gmail works, then I would ask them to use it.

For this, I have set up google site FSKIARD <https://sites.google.com/site/fskiard/home>.
Open Access, Open Data and FOSS are just being talked in Agricultural Research Institutes in India. Hyderabad is now hub of good number of institutes working on various crops and aspects. I am talking to few of my friends in Hyderabad who are working in those institutes for organizing a sensitization and capacity building workshop applications of FOSS in agricultural research and how to share the research outputs (information & data) with the world.
The Directorate of Rice Research, Hyderabad had build Rice Knowledge Management Portal <http://www.rkmp.co.in>, please look at it and I visualize that all the institutes should have their repositories to share knowledge and use the FOSS in research and communications.
I would like to know if any one in Hyderabad would like to support this event by anyÂ  means.Thanks & RegardsSridhar__________________________________________________________

Anyways, this is something that I have been thinking about. At Arghyam, we have adopted the creative commons licensing as well. Our latest publication ( a water quality framework for India) is coming out with the creative commons licensing. And we shall extend the same to our past publications as well ( Thanks to Pranesh for clarifying some of our doubts)
Maybe this should also be one of the goals of India Water Portal - to help traditional water NGOs to adopt creative commons licensing - both for content and data sets. Maybe we can extend this work to non-water NGOs as well. 
Would need some help in this though.Best,Deepak Menon,

I guess they've made a policy of it and it's excellent that they are trying to build a well-design open-access platform. From what I understand of their pricing model, they still sell hardcopies of their books and reports at a price (and a high ones at that!) but PDFs and ebooks come free. 
It's great that Arghyam has gone the same way - at Public Affairs Centre we're trying the same thing as well. I've figured out most of the pricing options, but it would be great if someone could shed light on exactly these topics - how to switch to open access publishing and creative commons licenses; and how to retroactively apply them.

                    Hey all,
                Just wanted to say that the ODC videos are going up one at a time. The first is another hour away from finishing upload and the second will go up tomorrow.For those wondering why we couldn't just take videos off the camera and upload, the process is a bit more complicated:You may have noticed that we were not using any special audio equipment to record. This is because waiting for a mike breaks the flow of conversation in small rooms. It's more fluid when people can speak up without waiting.Â We were recording audio directly on the camera.Our cameras do 5.1ch and can separate audio from different directions, emphasizing on front, but they will still pick up closer audio, from AC hum to whispered conversation to knocks on the tripod. Also, some speakers have soft voices. To get a clear audio stream, we normalize the audio, apply some noise cancellation (just enough to remove AC hum without making voices squeaky), then listen to the entire conversation for soft voices that need amplifying. This takes 30-45 minutes for an hour-long video. Since we shoot in high bitrate HD 1080, exporting for upload at HD 720 takes up to three hours per hour of video and the upload itself takes 1-4 hours depending on the connection.All together, it's quite a bit of work to produce each video, so we'll be putting out 1-2 videos every day for the next couple weeks.Best,Kiran

 any suggestions python packages that can help generate reports with 
predefined templates. For e.g, you may have seen http://www.klp.org.in/reports/Kannada/MP_Bangalore_Central.pdf we generated as edu profile information reports per constituency.
This is printed of the web page backed by a charting app in web.py and uses css for styling and google chart api for charting. If
 I had build the same thing completely off the browser as a backend 
process, do you have any recommendations of python packages you may have
 used - the whole process of charting, fitting it to a templates, 
unicode support and pdf generation.And I'd love something that'll allow me to retain this styling and print html to pdf, not having to deal with Latex and such.People have recommended ReportLab (but I was told it's not good for non-latin fonts, we use Kannada), pyfpdf, pyx...
I'm looking to see if any of you here have any other recommendations.

FA (in CBSE) is internal assessment and teachers tend to be lenient or jack-up the scores. If there are many ups and downs for the class then there is something wrong either with the exam or the evaluation. 
In the school that is not good in academics (School 2 ) this pattern is very clear. The question that follows is why the school is lenient in only select set of exams. The exam where there is huge drop are written exams (good old style of testing). Since they have to retain the original answer paper for inspection from external source, they tend to be more correct in evaluation and thus poor scores. 
And another point about not giving detailed explanation is - I'm of the belief that just do the Data Visualization and let the 'far more knowledgeable' target audience (in this case teachers, but this applies to any field) do the questioning than pre-empt them with recommendation or interpretation. That is more fun!

It has a visual designer which exports the Xform to server. You can
also design your forms in excel and upload it to server.
server application can create bar/pie charts, export data to CSV or
google fusion tables.
viewer / collector / admin roles can be assigned to user. but you can
not control it on form basis.
Data can be collected offline / online and sync later.

ODK has a vibrant community and lot of derived projects.

Also take a look at EpiCollect http://www.epicollect.net/ and FormHub

I have a ODK instance running. Let me know if you want to play with

From the response, to the sponsor support,  to the panel suggestions, to the caliber of people who came and participated it is hard for me to put into words how as a group we accomplished something very groundbreaking!
The volunteers were amazing and the commitment at the event was definitely something that gives me a lot of encouragement that we can actually get things off the ground. Some Data :)
Total amount of people who expressed interest in coming to the event: 270Total Attendee: 140Sponsorship pledges equaled almost: 3 LakhsWe trended on Twitter which is no small feat considering a ruby conference was happening at the same time. 
Because of Google's generosity we didn't have to worry about a lot of the logistics. Also since we literally organized this event in about 2 months some of the money came late. So we didn't spend it all. But I think it might be interesting to work with the sponsors to see if we can use this money for future events this year.
Major Learnings and Next Steps:We did a good job setting the tone of the event as not a tech heavy event. We communicated effectively that this group is thoughtful and cares about how data is useful and impactful and not just about the technical issues regarding data. I think this allowed the non tech crowd (a few but good amount of people) to really engage and talk about other issues. 
The panels were really great and people enjoyed them. I didn't hear any complaining about them and if there were suggestions people took it upon themselves to have the conversations independently which is exactly what we hope to happen. 
There have been a few who have suggested (and I agree) this should be a two day event. With something like a hackathon included. We should also start organizing little sooner and think about how we widen our circle a little bit. 
There is a high likelihood that there will be another event in Hydrabad, maybe in June. There is a lot of interest and commitment to make it happen.  I think we should get together and start planning in April. 
But I think we should consider not calling it DataCamp. What will work in Bangalore might not work somewhere else. I think different places have different strengths and the word data can be a little offputting. A few suggestions. Another Transparency Camp, Accountability Camp, RTI Camp, Open Camp, Tech for Change...
Not saying we can't call it DataCamp again ever. But we should think about how we include different audiences who are in fact engaging with data but aren't really accustomed to calling it that. 
I will be inviting all who were there or interested in attending to join this group. Let's continue doing what we do, sharing the work we are doing and the data we are working with.

I am a climate change & public policy researcher with a small non-profit called Public Affairs Centre, in Bangalore. For about 2 years now I've been tinkering with climate data, finding a lot of closed doors, while also finding some unusual and surprising sources of good data. I plan to spend my allotted time talking about data sources, some interesting analyses and visualisations, and some ideas for where this data-savvy community could pitch in.

Hello Nisha and Thejesh,


Hope you are doing well. My colleagues and I just found out about your upcoming Open Data Camp 2012 scheduled for this Saturday. Very interesting event and wish we had found out about it earlier. I work for World Bank Finances, the World Bank's open financial data program. Getting in touch to  share with you information about our program and also explore possibilities for a remote participation in Saturday's event. Saw some late afternoon open slots on your schedule.  

Part of the World Bank's open data initiative, and available through a website and mobile app, World Bank Finances makes the Bank's financial data more accessible and transparent.  On the website, you can explore the Bank’s current and historical loan, credit, grant, fund, and budget information. You can sort, filter, visualize, and share (through social media & via embed) the data, which is also available through an API. You can take a look at our  social stream to see the types of things people are doing with our financial data.  The mobile application gives you  convenient access to the Bank’s current investments (IBRD and IDA) at the country, project, loan/credit/grant levels. Citizen engagement is an especially important feature – the app makes it easier for people to report issues related to data accuracy, corruption and fraud.
Our goal is to reach and engage citizens interested in the Bank’s financial data and empower them to participate in the development process. 

Here is a link  to our short video and some resources on India from our website and app.  

Do let us if we can join you on Saturday. If not keep us posted about  future events / possible areas of collaboration.  

With best regards,
Nardos

Unfortunately, after a brief discussion with Thejesh, I realize that I'm late to the party, even though we have open slots in the schedule, registration is closed and the attendee count sent to Google is final. Thejesh suggested that if there is someone here who has registered but will not be able to attend, then I may trade places and still get a chance to present the below talk —Proposal:The talk, titled ""What is Data?"", will be an exploration of how scholars through history and across disciplines like Information Science, Computer Science, Epistemology etc. have defined data and which of these definitions will be interesting and relevant going forward as data becomes abundant and data analysis starts to play a crucial role in fields where it wasn't, traditionally, as important.Even if I cannot attend this time, I would love to hear your thoughts on the above proposal, what do you think? will it make for an interesting discussion at future events?If in case, you're unable to attend but you've already registered, then please please please, can I attend in your place :)Thank you all,With best regards,Mrinal@mrinal"

Hi Mrinal, I really like this proposal. This is an issue that I have been trying to work on myself, because the more “data becomes abundant”, the more pressing this question becomes as to what is data. And how data is becoming important given the increasing emphasis on personalization.

An open standard will promote the creation of tools and servicesworldwide that will enable citizen participation in the legislativeprocess and will enhance how governments make the laws they produce moretransparent.Today there is a great deal of inconsistency in how open participationand transparency are achieved around the world. Putting cultural andpolitical differences aside, part of the reason for the inconsistency isthe tremendous effort and cost involved in building the infrastructureto support these new objectives. An open standard will start to solvethis problem by promoting the establishment of a real legal informaticsindustry of interoperable tools and services which can easily be puttogether to address whatever committment a government has made to openand transparent government.Akoma Ntoso is an emerging standard the promises to do just this. It isan XML schema, developed by the University of Bologna in Italy. It wasdeveloped for Africa i-Parliaments, a project sponsored by UnitedNations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. In the coming weeks,an OASIS technical committee will begin the process of turning thisstandard into an international standard. I am a participant on that TC.To further promote and to publicize Akoma Ntoso, I am working with AriHershowitz #arihersh to stage an international hackathon within the nextfew months. The idea is to provide an event for people that willdemystify XML and Akoma Ntoso (yes, it is hard to say) by providing areally easy way for anyone to create a document using the proposedstandard. Our goal will be to collect a world’s worth of legislativesamples. This could be an important step towards building a library thatstitches together all the world’s laws and regulations in an open andtransparent way.We’re currently seeking sponsors, participants, and venues for thishackathon. The interest we have found so far has been quite amazing.

Helping people sign up for sessions.General help with answering questions and getting people help.Live tweeting and some photo taking will be greatly appreciated. 
Also after the event I will need some help with follow up. Making sure people who came or signed up are invited to datameet to continue the conversation.I don't think we need to have a meeting. I will contact those that have volunteered today with tasks and a schedule.
Also we will have a few tshirts for the volunteers will keep you updated. We need to send out a mail to all who have signed up asking them to reconfirm their attendance and sending them logistic information. Then Thursday we can give the final list to Google.

We think it might be good to propose some themes for sessions but not make them mandatory as people might feel inhibited. So feel free to share themes on this thread and we will discuss during one of the opening panels.
We should all think about who are really good people to invite to the event and send out invites. I will resend the invite language. Keep in mind We are sold out!!!  But obviously not all of the people who sign up will come. It is a long weekend so we are betting that about half will come. So as you continue to invite people tell them to sign up for the waiting list and they will still get to come.
Next Wednesday we will send all who have registered a note asking them to reconfirm. They can not make it, to please unregister to give others a chance who really want to do.  If there is a farily high ranking person who wants to come please send me their email I will put them on the guest list. 
I will send out a few more emails regarding sessions and some other ideas that have been raised for the event. Google will cover:Registration and name tags - process below
Wifi, projectorsPens and PaperFoodParking:There is a limited number so we have to tell people if they don't have to drive don't. Will have more logistics later. 
Process for registration:go to the 4th floor of Google to get your name badgeevent will be on 5th floorWhat needs to be done:Tshirts for volunteers - Sreechand

I really want sessions to be proposed by the group not just by Thej, Anand, and me. So please send your ideas to us and we will put them up. Any ideas are welcome. But know that the board will be up on the event day and will be populated in BarCamp style (like Thej explained).  So let's spend a week asking around and see what people are interested in talking about and putting them on the site and get people excited about presenting and showing off their projects.

Hi Kiran,Does sponsoring a travel, attracts tax? what kind of? what rate? Can you elaborate on tax part.Hi Jayesh,If the sponsor reimburses the person who has borne the travel cost directly and obtains the tickets/boarding cards in lieu of the reimbursement, no tax is involved. 
If the sponsor pays the intermediary - say Nisha and Thej - then there is service tax and TDS involved. Nisha and Thej are not registered trusts or charity institutions. Hence, they have to bear service tax and TDS for the amount given in sponsorship. 
If Nisha and Thej decide to route the money through a NGO, they typically have to pay 20% of that amount to the NGO which the NGO uses for managing the money, maintaining accounts and filing taxes with the Charity Commissioner. 
Kiran can elaborate more on this.Cheers,Zainab

I'm a researcher and am eager to know more about collaborations
related to open street mapping being undertaken by many organizations
across the globe. Starting from India, there are many organizations
doing independent projects. How can all this be consolidated on one
platform and help in churning out meaningful thematic data for eg. as
report cards on development work/infrastructure/basic services mapping
that can be brought about for different wards/areas/by MLAs as well
engage citizens in the process. This would need a network of
government, private and ngo groups and a lot more. Is it possible for
someone to address this aspect if its being undertaken somewhere or I
hope some ideas and discussion kick off on this issue.

Good luck with the preparations and please let me know if I can help
out in any way.

This Open Data Camp would bring together all the main development sector actors working with/on open data. Some of them include Nonprofit Organizations like India Water Portal, Akshara Foundation, Accountability Initiative, Azim Premji University and Mapunity; 
Also, the Indian Government, has just passed the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy - essentially the Open Data Policy for India. The policy itself is rotten and nothing to do with 'open' and 'sharing'; but considering that before this policy all data in India was part of the 'Official Secrets Act', this is no small gain.
Policy and Advocacy Groups like Centre for Internet and Society, Tactical Tech Collective, and of course the Government of India from NIC and Kerala IT Mission; 
and, the broader interest group that include Technologists, and Technology Companies (from Google, Microsoft, and Gramener), designers and Design Schools, Journalists and Media Groups.
I hope you can attend the event. Registration is compulsory to attend the event.   Please register at http://opendatacampbangalore2012.doattend.com/ (we are sold out but please sign up on the waiting list so we can add your name to the registrants) 
You can find more about the event @ http://odc.datameet.org    -- its still under progress. I will keep updating it.
If you have any questions feel free to contact me at any time.

Cartonama is conceived around the idea that people need to learn more about the tools with which they can manage their geographic data. This workshop will provide a platform for developers, neogeographers and entrepreneurs working on location based services to get hands-on training about advanced tools - server side and client side - that will help them to manage and represent their geographic data. See http://workshop.cartonama.com for more details.
The workshop will be facilitated by Mikel Maron and Schuyler Erle, both of who have been working extensively with Open Street Maps (OSM), open data, mapping tools and communities. 
The workshop sessions have been posted on http://funnel.hasgeek.com/cartonama-workshop/.
This workshop is open only to 30 participants. The ticket price is Rs. 10,000. Registrations are open on cartonama.doattend.com. Payments can also be sent through cheques and DD.

Erica will speak on the theme: ""From Information to Empowerment: Unpacking the Equation"". Below is the gist of Erica's talk. 
Interested persons need to confirm attendance by registering at http://geekup.in/2012/erica-hagen 
From Information to Empowerment - Unpacking the Equation: In 2010, Erica Hagen and Mikel Maron started GroundTruth Initiative to work towards empowering communities through open data, open information and participatory processes. Erica's and Mikel's work at GroundTruth is informed by their earlier experience of working with the Map Kibera project where they helped the youth and the communities in Kibera to map their geographies and represent information about themselves to the world through citizen media. In the process, Erica and Mikel uncovered several complex dynamics about self-representation by communities, what open data really means to communities and how they apply it to their circumstances, the dynamics between participatory development and participatory technologies, and the process of using community media tools and online methods for talking about issues that matter to them.
In this lecture, Erica Hagen will talk about her work with communities in Kenya, Jerusalem, Nigeria and other parts of the world through GroundTruth Initiative. Specifically, Erica will unpack the relationship between empowerment, information, and storytelling, and what both these elements mean to communities in different parts of the world. How are communities applying the information and data that they collect about their governments and themselves? What are the challenges involved in the process of working with open data, participatory processes and technologies? How can communities apply new media and data gathering tools to achieve local goals? What does empowerment mean in the face of the delicate lines and precariousness that communities and the interveners/practitioners have to tread in the process of data gathering, representation, communication and outputs?

The first lecture begins with Richard Saul Wurman’s famous call for “making the city observable” to interrogate different practices of seeing the city through cartography and other visual means and how those shape our everyday urban experiences and decisions. In the first lecture, we are especially interested in having a discussion on how specific ways of ‘seeing’ or ‘visualising’ the city can create or dismantle urban hierarchies, and also what ways of ‘seeing’ the city dominate the urban discourse in India.
We are honoured to announce that Dr. Solomon Benjamin and Prof. Jörg Stollmann will deliver the lectures at this first event.For further details, please see the attached flyer.Speakers and Moderator
Dr. Benjamin is an urbanist operating out of Bangalore. He is faculty at the Manipal School of Architecture and Planning, and a senior research associate with the French Institute Pondicherry. Prof. Stollmann is co-founder of urbaninform and an architect and urban designer based in Zurich. His practice ranges from design projects to urban research and curatorial work.
The session will be moderated by Zainab Bawa, a PhD scholar at the Centre for the Study of Culture and Society, Bangalore, working on the changing land regulations, regimes and property relations that are transforming the landscape of politics and economy in large Indian cities.
Venue and TimeThe lecture will be held on Thursday, 9th February, 2012, at 6:30 pm in Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan, located in 716 CMH Road, Indiranagar 1st Stage (map).

our new water application?

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

The Pacific Institute, in collaboration with several other groups, is
about to launch the beta version of a new Android phone application
(""WeTap"") for mapping drinking water fountains worldwide.

This app will let you upload information about fountains in your
area, and it will let you look at a map of all the nearby fountains
when you are thirsty and looking for public water (because you don't
want to buy a plastic bottle, right?).

We are looking for volunteers interested in downloading this app on
their Android phones (free) and testing it -- playing around with it,
mapping local fountains, and sending us feedback.

Please let me know if you are interested, by sending me an email.

Peter

Open data can be used to build transparency and accountability improve dialogue and efficiency and get a good sense of how to evaluate progress of schemes and be used to create projects.  With the goal of using data to create impact in people lives we hope this event will be a platform for people to share, challenge, think through problems, and build upon ideas that can get us closer to that goal.

It is a short list. I still think we can get up to 300 invites out I will continue to add through out the week but everyone should add a few names here and there because our collective knowledge of the space should be able to get a complete list of all who are working with data.

Please add anyone you see fit. Also I will update email addresses as I go along however, if you have contact information feel free to add it. As you invite people please let me or the list know so that we can keep track of things.
Also does anyone have a Do Attend Account? Would it be possible to collect the money thru Has Geek? Would that be easier?Also here is the sponsorship form with language for what we need for the event. 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WOT4FB-nttZRoUbd5NbhtjFqTEvbX--0m1il5qrhxB0/editYou can use that form for invitee language as well. 
Also I think we are going to commit to Feb 25th. However as we will don't have a venue yet I'll keep you all updated as to what the status of that is. Hopefully we will get one soon.

World Bank launches Apps For Climate and Climate Change Knowledge Portal
On December 2nd, 2011, the World Bank Group announced Apps For Climate, a competition to discover extraordinary ways to use open data to address the challenges of climate change.
Apps For Climate competition aims to bring together the best ideas from scientists, application developers, civil society organizations, and development practitioners to create innovative software apps using World Bank climate data. Applications must be received by March 16, 2012; winners will receive cash prizes and featured placement on the World Bank Open Data website.
To qualify, apps must use at least one open dataset from the World Bank Data Catalog. For more information visit the challenge page and follow Apps for Climate on Twitter: @worldbankdata, #apps4climate

 
World Bank climate data are accessible from a new Climate Change page. that provides links to a the Climate Change Knowledge Portal, Climate Change data topic page, the Open Data for Resilience Initiative, the Apps for Climate competition, and other Open Data resources such as World Development Indicators data and data catalog.

International capital flows: What actually happened in 2010?
New data from the Debt Reporting System show net capital flows to developing countries in 2010 rose to their pre-crisis levels.
At a time when many developed economies saw the most severe slowdown since the end of WWII, capital flows to the developing world were on the rise. All expectations were that they would increase sharply in 2010 given the fact that, on average, GDP growth in developing countries was 8 percent in 2010 and their imports were up 27 percent in US dollar terms. But, none of the prior estimates came close to the actual outcome.
According to the just-published Global Development Finance 2012: External Debt of Developing Countries, which contains detailed data on the external debt of 129 developing countries, net capital flows soared to $1130 billion in 2010 putting them back at their 2007 pre-crisis peak and well on their way to double the $675 billion recorded in 2009.

Open Aid Partnership
The World Bank, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, Estonia, and Finland have announced their endorsement of the Open Aid Partnership in Busan, Korea, during the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness.
It brings development partners together to enhance the openness and effectiveness of development assistance. The immediate goal is to synchronize the mapping tools among donors and pilot its use in certain countries to better monitor the impact of development programs on citizens, and seek direct feedback on project results.

Congrats Maya and CIS, specifically Nishant, for pulling it together. CIS was packed with people interested in discussing the bigger picture of data and it was a great talk and really got me excited about pursuing data as a community! So with that in mind and after meeting with several people working with data and reflecting on the experience on Transparency Camp last June. It seems that the time is right to plan another camp to bring together people working on data. 
So I'm proposing this group organize a DataCamp in Bangalore sometime late in February. I'm fairly confident we can attract enough sponsors and get a really great and diverse group of people to come and share their experiences.  My hope is to get people working on a lot of different projects to come and share their experience, the challenges, the triumphs, and lastly how can Indian data be used in a way to make impact. (And also what the shortfalls of looking just at data are.)
I'm happy to be the point person for this endeavor. If we call brainstorm places to ask for sponsorship and come up with a list of 300 invitees I think we will be in a good place to really go after this and make it a great event!

To: ""Discussion list on Indian language projects of Wikimedia."" <

Hi all,

Wikimedia would be a starting new project ""WikiData"". Details here[1] . I am
particularly excited about how the interwiki data and ""API"" Â is made
available and hope it would be immense use to all Indic languages, many
possibilities of mashups, data extractions might be easier with the
infrastructure. Sundar's idea to target Indic users using interwiki
metadata, apps like interwikiredirector[2], can benefit significantly out of
this. We shall look forward to hear more details on the project and wish all
the success both technically, community wise.

I would like to thank CIS for providing space and lunch. It was a great meeting and we were lucky to have great insights from Sunil. We left the meeting with a few great ideas and a list of a few government folks who we can connect with to move forward.
Also next month I hope we can have the meeting at Mapunity so that Ashwin can be looped into the work we are doing.Update about UID.I spoke Srikanth Nadhamuni this past weekend at the water hackathon. He said after his meeting with us he put a team together to create an API of UID data!!! 
He also apologizes for not getting back to Brij and few others who emailed him. He said that he wants the API done before he will loop us in and will keep in touch with me about when it is done.

How is the State? - Accessing Water and the State in Mumbai and Johannesburg” has appeared in the latest Special Issue on “Accessing the State” in the Journal of Asian and African Studies. I’d be happy to share a copy of the article with anyone who is interested in reading it.
Abstract: This article examines the water distribution systems in Johannesburg and Mumbai to argue that the political and institutional contexts of service delivery shape people’s access to the state and its resources, and also mediation between citizens and government institutions by councillors. Through ethnographies of water supply and distribution systems in Mumbai and Johannesburg, I explain how the organizational structure of the water utility, institutional arrangements of service delivery, regulatory systems, councillors’ proximity to decision makers and their relationship with municipal officials, civil servants and party members variously influence councillors’ mediation capacities and their ability to fulfil the claims of their constituencies for piped water supply and connections.

Our target audience is people from small-towns who engage with the Panchayati system. 
The objective of the session on open data is basically to help them understand what is open data and the varying positions taken up by the govt, department, civil society in India. 
Any pointers would be appreciated! BestLaina

I haven’tdone a precise count yet, but close to half of the nearly 40 providersthat have already expressed interest in working with governments underthe OGP Networking Mechanism are software vendors, developers, or otherproviders of technology solutions for open government challenges,particularly web-based solutions. Many of them are involved with “opendata” projects, which seek to unlock and put online a range ofgovernment data in machine readable, mashable formats.The obvious explanation (in my mind) for why “open data” gets so muchattention in the context of “open government” is that it is the sexiest,flashiest reform of the bunch. It’s much cooler (and frankly lesspolitically controversial) for any government to put government healthdatabases online (along with an iPhone app! Android coming soon!) thanit is for the same government to provide greater transparency around thefinancing of political parties in the country.But it does raise a core concern that we at Global Integrity (and othersinvolved in the early discussions around OGP) have voiced several timesbefore: does the OGP risk becoming a platform on which to proselytize tothe world about the virtues of data.gov and similar open data projects?We worry that this isn’t enough by itself.Why I mention this in the context of OGP is that there is a concernshared amongst some of us involved that open data provides an easy wayout for some governments to avoid the much harder, and likely moretransformative, open government reforms that should probably be higherup on their lists. Instead of fetishizing open data portals for the sakeof having open data portals, I’d rather see governments incorporatingopen data as a way to address more fundamental structural challengesaround extractives (through maps and budget data), the political process(through real-time disclosure of campaign contributions), or budgetpriorities (through online publication of budget line-items).Granted, you can make a counter argument that open data is the “gatewaydrug” to much deeper and challenging open government reforms, but untilI see that happen in practice I’ll remain a healthy skeptic.So when I see the [Kenyan government’s new open data portal][] (overwhich many behind the US and UK data sites are absolutely gushing, andat the time of this posting was actually down!), I can only wonderwhether the time, expenses, and political capital devoted to buildingthat website were really the best uses of resources. To vastlyunderstate the problem, Kenya has a range of governance and opengovernment challenges that go far beyond the lack of a website wherecitizens (many of whom are not online) can chart government datasets.We’ve started to hear similar concerns from some of the technicalproviders involved with building the US and UK open data projects (manyof these providers have expressed their willingness to work with othergovernments under the auspices of OGP). The basic message has been,“Yeah, there’s been plenty of excitement at political levels for theseprojects, but it’s hard to say how significant the use or uptake [of thedata] has been.” A similar refrain has been “Everyone expects theprivate sector to simply jump in and build a bunch of ‘apps.’ But wearen’t really seeing that and don’t expect too much to happen apart fromapps using geospatial data.”Sobering stuff. The open data movement is clearly still in its infancyand major successes may be yet to come. But in the interim, some cautionmay be in order before we launch a global campaign to liberate everylast bit of government data out there, especially in lower-incomecontexts where the opportunity costs may be massive.— Nathaniel Heller  [Open Government Partnership]: http://opengovpartnership.org  [OGP’s Networking Mechanism]:http://www.globalintegrity.org/blog/call-for-ogp-networking  [Kenyan government’s new open data portal]: http://opendata.go.ke/-- Pranesh PrakashProgramme ManagerCentre for Internet and SocietyW: http://cis-india.org | T: +91 80 40926283"

Protovis needs some patience and loads of hair. Eagereyes tutorial is pretty good to start off, and some more knowledge of javascript can get you going to the higher levels fast.
I started off doing a project which basically is a repository for all kinds of charts doable using protovis - these charts would have all the components(like mouse-hover, legend,ticks etc etc) and all you need is patience to go through the code comments(not code!) and some knowledge of json to create your own maps in minutes. 
[There was a guy in Protovis mailing group who did the UI equivalent(not exactly!) for this, some development on this front to improve this app would be neat too. Basically, make it an open source Tableau S/W]

I used to use Flex for my day job. Flex is awesome, but you have to spend 'money' on it, if you want to use for commercialÂ  purposes. Flex viz tookit is pretty impressive. In the recently concluded Mozilla Viz competition , many used charts based on Flash/Flex - one of them got a special mention.

4276,Pranesh Prakash,#topic/datameet/9MpPwVFLGwE,2,2011-09-25 22:37:00,Re: [datameet] Interesting Article re: Internet Governance at the UN,"My comments on the blog, and Kieren's response:Multilateral versus Multi-stakeholder / DNS SeizuresSubmitted by pranesh on 25 Sep 11.I think this is easily one of the better analysis pieces I've seen of the respective positions recently. However, I think it has at least two shortcomings and one blind spot.== Shortcomings ==1. On multilateral and multi-stakeholder, you write:""The two are mutually exclusive in this context.""And thus make it seem like some confusion, if one is charitable, or if one is less so: confusion and a cock-up on the part of the drafters. However, the context in which it is mentioned (the nature of internet governance) is the same as the context in which Para 29 of the Tunis Agenda (the paragraph titled ""Internet Governance"") laid this down:""The international management of the Internet should be multilateral, transparent and democratic, with the full involvement of governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations.""They are merely quoting the Tunis Agenda. If the problem you have with is the two words, then it is a problem you have with the Tunis Agenda, and not just with the IBSA declaration's juxtaposition of multilateral alongside multi-stakeholder.A critique from you of the Tunis Agenda's para 29 would be very helpful.And that would also go on to explain, I hope, why the repeated mentions of multi-stakeholderism in the brief IBSA summary (in the title, the first paragraph, as well as the laying-out-of-principles paragraph) are less convincing than the mentions of multi-stakeholderism in the eG8 and the OECD documents. (Surely, here it is salient to note that civil society participation in eG8 was severely limited and in the OECD's civil society reps, CSISAC, chose not to endorse the final communiquĂŠ, despite its mentions of multi-stakeholderism.)2. On reasons for the different positionsI think the explanations that you provide for the different positions (where you do provide them) are inadequate. Why are the IBSA countries adopting the position that they are (apart from their being inherently 'reactive')?Why are the US and European countries (and some others through the OECD) bunching up to produce joint statements when traditionally many of the US's interests vis-a-vis internet governance have not been shared by the European countries? Why are the divergent interest of the eG8 countries not factored into the text, which is not as status-quoist as you make it sound. (Medvedev had a strong difference of opinion from Sarkozy insofar as Sarko's 'civilizing' project included IPR.These are some things that I think you'd be in a good position to answer, and I think are things that need to be answered while trying to make sense of the differences in positions.== Blind Spot ==3. Carrying on from the previous point, I think a blind spot in this article is how internet governance is changing even outside of these attempts. Of course, that would have made this article too long, but a few links should have been provided. That information puts these attempts by these governments into context and appreciate why each holds the position that it does. (The only 'contextual' information of this sort that you provide is that of ICANN's various failings.)Just to give an example: DNS seizures by the US government disrupt the reliability of the DNS system for the whole world. That is an important disruption of the status quo in internet governance: unilateral non-accidental disruption of a CIR that affects the whole world. What is the right forum for other countries to oppose this? (Especially given that the efforts in US courts haven't succeeded and that the efforts aimed at the US legislative system don't seem promising.) While there are some, like Congresswoman Lofgren, who understand the risks, the ""number of proposals making their way through the US government"" include the PROTECT-IP Bill, which we both are in agreement would be a disaster.===All that apart, thanks again for the great article, Kieren. Hope to see regular updates from you on your blog and on Twitter through the IGF.====Good points, perhaps a post-IGF analysisSubmitted by admin on 25 Sep 11.Thanks for this Pranesh, thoughtful and insightful. You are right, of course, these are highly complex issues and for the sake of brevity this article boils that down.The G8 and the OECD statements were noticeably lacking in civil society support - which is telling on both sides. And there does need to be greater analysis of IBSA's position. I have summarized it as the up-and-coming group putting itself in the middle of the other two positions, but it is a little more complex than that.It is probably also needed/useful to pull in the Tunis Agenda - although the discussions around what was meant by the creatively ambiguous wording in that agreement could fill a series of articles in itself.And, yes, many of these papers - especially coming from governments - are only one part of an Internet governance world that is being shaped and changed every day by real-world actions in response to the problems that the Internet constantly throws out.So, I suspect the best thing would be to see what happens and what is discussed at the IGF this week; see what, if anything, happens at the UN GA this month and then write another piece addressing the weaknesses of this one.CheersKierenOn 2011-09-26T10:56:59 IST, Nisha Thompson wrote:> http://news.dot-nxt.com/2011/09/22/internet-governance-fight-looms>> Seems that a lot is happening at the global level with Internet governance> and standards.

Clearly these complaints need to be directed at local municipality and panchayat level departments. Not surprising issues aren't being addressed. My thoughts are about the kinds of (media) (digital) literacy that are required to have a conversation about corruption, transparency and governance, as well as about how projects don't seem to work with and respond to the very people who should be responding to things like ""trees in the middle of the road"". In this clamouring for anti corruption, transparency, how much are we responding to the people who are the cogs in the machinery?

We have proactively reached out to some NGO's who are still timid about getting in.For efforts like this to succeed, its needs a snow ball effect. Happy to explore options to get this going. We are happy to open our data to any NGO that wants to use it (the data is still very low)

I currently work with a bunch of students and one of our focus is to research public data sets in India and try and build Apps around them. Wanted some pointers on key data sets available online, for example Political, Social, Economic ? Are these getting aggregated in a single data source, or are their multiple forums.

Nah, you need special glasses, like the ones you are given to watch 3d movies, to see the data. After all, even when data is evident, it's many meanings are not so evident! Or, the meanings are evident in some ways to some people who read and interpret the data in certain ways! ;)

The reqt, is that I draw a circle on our map here, centered around a certain point, like Cantonment Station maybe. So, questions
1) GPS Visualiser helps me with some text file with the circle's coordinates, a gpx format , a kml format which I'm not sure how i can use with my existing map. Any pointers to a write up or tips here in would be helpful.
2) How can I work independent off GPS Visualizer to generate these gpx(s) and kml(s)? Have any of you used any other libraries? I understand Google Map allows the URL request parameters to determine this circle. But there seems to be some close kml dependencies.

I can try and answer:

1. The Right to Education mandates a primary school within 2KM and a
secondary school within 3KM. One option is to draw circles at those
radii from each primary and secondary schools and to figure out where
gaps are.It would be interesting to see how the 'as the crow flies' distance will compare to the actual path distance. In rural areas, i would expect quite a big difference between the two, especially if there are geographical features like a hill or river that come in the way.
In any case, a properly calibrated heatmap will do the trick quite nicely. That way, it would take into consideration the distance of a point from a school as well, instead of just a binary yes/no interpretation. Worth a try: http://geochalkboard.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/density-mapping-in-google-maps-with-heatmapapi/
  2. We get a lot of enquiries of the type: 


2.1 I live in X - what are the schools within 1/2/3/4/5 KM?
2.2. Donor Y says what are the schools within 1/2/3/4/5 KM of my
office that I can volunteer at.

In which case for 2, what we thought we could do is tale the point of
their house or office (either they can mark it on the map or we can
input a lat/lon and it returns those schools (points with lat/long)
within that area.

Maybe there's a better way of doing this?
Ah, so you draw the circle at the home/office location, makes sense. This is fairly simple to implement with a postgis query. Or it can get even simpler if you approximate the circular area to a square bounding box instead.

Indeed but is there a way to calculate straight line vs. actual path
distance? Because the latter is more meaningful.
It can be done, although with a bit of effort. The biggest challenge for this is a vector database of the road networks. If the openstreetmap data for the area of interest is good, this can be processed in qgis/grass to generate actual shapefiles of the coverage area. I dont think there is any other way of doing this without using a gis application.

That's what I have been told. Apparently a square is easier than a
circle. Why is that?
A box is defined by four edges and you can find points using lesser than, greater than operators. With a circle, you would need to do some complex maths or have a db with a gis extension. Operations in a cartesian space are much simpler than polar ones.

http://www.ing.unitn.it/~grass/docs/tutorial_64_en/htdocs/esercitazione/network_analysis/node5.html

We can take an hybrid approach. For a distance d, get all the points within distance 2d (by flying). And for those points calculate the distance by road using Gmaps API. Filter those within the range of d.
Looks like very workable approach.

Indeed but is there a way to calculate straight line vs. actual path
distance? Because the latter is more meaningful.

Cool. Thanks.

That's what I have been told. Apparently a square is easier than a
circle. Why is that?

I work with Akshara Foundation & the Karnataka Learning Partnership on the tech aspects of data management and in recent times as part of our interest in advocacy through www.klp.org.in, we intend to build reports that showcase the Education Profile for an MP/MLA Constituency or Ward. I'm attaching a bilingual and the equivalent English report, so we can get some feedback from this group.
This is the first of 3 reports, a 2 pager to be printed on one sheet and handed out to Elected reps. This one is on demographics, we hope to have the second on financials and the last on learning levels in the two quarters. The reports will also be available on the website soon.
Currently, in terms of Technology, the report uses google visualization api and reads from a postgres db via a simple web.py based app. We chose to use bars and pies because of the familiarity of these visualization means. We're hoping to move a more light weight reporting platform, with which Rahul (also on this group) is helping.
Two specific questions apart from any feedback you may have:a) Is there data out there or in here that you think can be leveraged on to make a report such as this more useful?b) If we were to share any part of this data / entirely what format would help collaboration?

Also we are working on cleaning up Arghyam's ASHWAS survey data <http://ashwas.indiawaterportal.org/>. We will definitely let you know when this data is available to start looking through and playing with. 
Part of this project that we really need help with is scrapping and cleaning up data. So we found these sources but the formats are not open, they are either PDFs, Excel, HTML etc. So we need help figuring out how to scrape these and make this information open. 
These websites have data we're most interested in:
http://nirmalgrampuraskar.nic.in/http://tsc.gov.in/http://ddws.nic.in/
So any advice or what the process is to scrap and clean up this information would be really helpful.Also there is a world wide Water Hackathon in October <http://www.waterhackathon.org/>. Arghyam is going to participate and it would be great to brainstorm with people who are interested in taking part also. So hopefully at next month's meeting we can discuss some ideas as well.
There was a lot in this email. But 
I'm really excited about being part of this community and seeing all the
 great projects and stories that everyone here will create and also tackling the issues around opening up data.Looking forward to your thoughts!Nisha-- Nisha ThompsonMobile: 962-061-2245

4373,Karthik Bettadapura,#topic/datameet/Q7HwL82nC3c,2,2011-08-18 07:18:00,Re: [datameet] Follow up from yesterday,"Hi,Really interesting work that you guys are doing. Would like to provide some inputs on scraping and crawling data:Extract data from pdf documents:pdfs are the most difficult document format to extract textual data from, keeping the structure of the text being intact. We normally use pdf to text converters. Then we apply heuristics to extract data to preserve semantics. We also tried another available tool pdf2table extractor (http://ieg.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/projects/pdf2table/) that tries to extract tables in pdf documents with some success.
Extract data from Excel sheets and csv documents:It is relatively easier to extract text from excel sheets. Some customization is needed with respect to the columnname-value mapping. 
Extract data from HTML pages:Easy if the data resides on unique urls. But if the sites adopt to POSTing values or passing on some hidden session values, then it becomes a challenge. It would need some analysis on how the sites are passing on values and customize scripts accordingly.
If data is uniformly represented (clean), then using some of the above methods we can extract data. But, if data is not uniformly represented, then it becomes really difficult. The extraction scripts will then have to be painfully customized to get relevant data.
Hope that helps.Thanks,Karthik.www.dataweave.in"

    Hey Everyone,

    For those of you who don't know me my name is Nisha Thompson and I
    am currently working on an update for the Open Government Data
    report for CIS <http://cis-india.org/> and on
    the Data project for India Water Portal <http://www.indiawaterportal.org/>.
    Maya Ganesh from Tactical Tech <http://www.tacticaltech.org/>
    and I have been talking about our shared interest in the uses of
    open and community-owned/aggregated data for advocacy and thought we
    could float the idea of an informal monthly meeting of data geeks
    and information visualisers and designers in Bangalore.

    Â There are a few groups and people in Bangalore who are working on
    data issues in advocacy and we thought it could be interesting for
    us to meet and get a sense of each other's challenges, initiatives,
    ideas. This could be a space to bounce ideas off of and get support
    for various endeavors, collaborate, share and learn and also talk
    about some of the other issues data raise: data journalism, the
    visual design of data, the ownership and accessibility of data to
    different communities, the impact of data in campaigns ... We're
    also keen on good coffee and cookies :-)

    Personally I hope to discuss ways to get data, how to make it
    impactful, and using it to change the way we talk to people in
    government to address quality of life issues.

    We're thinking of getting together on the Wednesday, the 17th of
    August at Matteo's on Church Street around 6pm for an hour at least.
    It would be great if you could make it, so if you're free just show
    up. There will be at least the two of us :-)

    Please do write in to me and Maya <ma...@tacticaltech.org>
    if you have any questions or thoughts.

    I look forward to meeting you all and getting the conversation
    started. Please feel free to invite others we might have left out.

    Thanks!

    Nisha

Since shapefiles are a superior vector format with georeferencing, it would have been ideal to have the data in this format. You can anytime do a  shp->svg conversion but not the other way around. 
For the latest district shapefiles, we will just have to hope that the census of India releases them. I dont think there's any other source as of now.If anyone is interested, the 2001 census district shapefiles are available from http://geocommons.com/overlays/131045 ( But it seems to have some missing shapes)
You can work with shapefiles using quantumgis/grass http://qgis.org/

Koshy, jac...@livemint.comIndia and the US are collaborating on the development of a technologyplatform to enable local state agencies to reorganize data, some ofwhich is restricted, in a format accessible on the Web.The move is aimed at improving transparency in governance by the UnitedProgressive Alliance (UPA) government, which has been facing charges ofcorruption in recent times.“This (platform) will be similar to an existing initiative by the UnitedStates government called data.gov and will be developed completely freeof cost,” said Aneesh Chopra, chief technology officer, office ofscience and technology in the US and an adviser to President BarackObama. “It’s part of the Obama government’s push to encouragetransparent sharing of resource information.”Data.gov in the US hosts data on a variety of topics ranging frompollution to accident trends in American cities.The initiative is a “win-win” for both countries, said Sam Pitroda, headof India’s National Knowledge Commission.“Both countries open up their resource banks to one another and thisreflects the new India, where communication between people and agenciesis happening at unprecedented levels from before,” Pitroda said on thesidelines of an industry event.The department of science and technology was framing a national dataaccess and sharing policy that could change the way the governmentmaintains and shares information, Mint had reported in January.The policy faced criticism from several agencies, including defence andhome affairs, but is now with the cabinet for a reappraisal, said anofficial.The policy will also compel departments and publicly funded bodies toscan their records, review the kind of data they maintain, and releasethis for public consumption, provided such information doesn’tcompromise security and strategic needs, said an official involved inframing the policy.“In the next few years, if a government department doesn’t shareinformation, it will have to give reasons why it isn’t doing so,” hesaid, requesting anonymity. “If it classifies some information asrestricted, it will have to justify its stance. That’s an inversion ofcurrent policy.”“Take Google Earth for instance,” the official said. “The Survey ofIndia has all that and much more. So it makes sense to release that,possibly allow other end-users to make better maps and maybe chargeend-users a nominal fee.”The access and sharing policy is the brainchild of Prime MinisterManmohan Singh, who signalled the new policy at the Indian ScienceCongress in Thiruvananthapuram last year.P. Banerjee, director of the National Institute of Science, Technologyand Development Studies, a Council of Scientific and Industrial Researchbody, is confident of several interesting studies involving the IndianInstitutes of Management and the Indian Institutes of Technology if theyrelease data.“There may be issues of privacy, but as long as you withhold names, Idon’t see why such data should be restricted in the first place,” he said.To be sure, government departments are unlikely to begin releasing dataany time soon as they need to work on getting their data interoperable.“Lots of interesting stuff is still in the files. Those that aredigitized are not flexible across operating systems,” said a scienceministry official, who didn’t want to be identified “That will take aminimum of two years.”-- Pranesh PrakashProgramme ManagerCentre for Internet and SocietyW: http://cis-india.org | T: +91 80 40926283"

Gen. (Dr.) R. Siva Kumar <siv...@nic.in> or Mr. Bhoop Singh <bhoop...@nic.in>.May I request that you pass on a copy of your comments to me as well (and tell others you know who're sending in comments to do so as well)?   We would like to compile civil society feedback to the draft policy. From the NSDI NDSAP website:The background paper: http://goo.gl/h3Rub (1 page, PDF)And from a ""Points to be considered for NDSAP"" document:> * With the advent of new technologies we need to have better access to information. In addition to operating the traditional request-based system where a member of the public asks for a government document and receives a hard copy (or an electronic one), through RTI, there is a need to proactively provide data where members of the public can search for material themselves. This should lead to “open government,” whereby citizens are able not only to obtain electronic access to government documents and services, but also to interact with them and give feedback on matters ranging from individual service problems to statistics and policy.> * Data available globally should become accessible to citizens and civil society. If we need weather data we should get it from our own agencies and not from NASA/NOAA.> * Open data policy will also increase credibility and accuracy of our own data sets and instill confidence. The disparate non performing data assets collected over centuries could be leveraged for the benefit of civil society.> * To start with we have to generate metadata (data about) to enable data discovery and its exploration for the developmental activities. This will avoid duplication/multiplication of data generation activities and also increase the reliability of data sets being used.> * The negative lists should automatically exclude the information that does not come under the purview of the RTI act.> * It requires the integration of new-generation digital media technologies into government structure and operations.> * Data generated using public funds should be accessible and available avoiding duplication of efforts> * We also need to strike a balance between the security and development, IPR, Privacy etc.> * The legacy data should be converted into digital form in a realistic time frame> * Besides the technical issues of interoperability and standards, legal, institutional and privacy issues also need to be addressed.Regards,Pranesh-- Pranesh PrakashProgramme ManagerCentre for Internet and SocietyW: http://cis-india.org | T: +91 80 40926283"

Once you start looking at data as a bug report it isn't a stretch to see how the benefits of a bug tracker come into play. Software devs know they just cannot build or maintain complex systems without a bug tracker and government is one of the most complex systems out there. Just food for thought...
4409,Pranesh Prakash,#topic/datameet/QPp5mbWlsA4,3,2011-07-21 01:50:00,"Re: Call for Comments on Draft National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy | Deadline: May 25, 2011","Dear all,I forgot to update this group with the comments that we from CISsubmitted.  One big problem with the policy is that it doesn't *require*that anything be placed in the 'open access' category. So everythingcan, theoretically, be placed in the 'restricted access' or the'registered access' categories.- Pranesh# Comments on the draft National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policyby [Pranesh Prakash][] in [Openness Blog][] — Jun 08, 2011 12:30 PMA draft of the 'National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy', whichsome hope will be the open data policy of India, was made available forpublic comments in early May. This is what the Centre for Internet andSociety submitted.These are the comments that we at the Centre for Internet and Societysubmitted to the National Spatial Data Infrastructure on the draft[National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy][].## Comments on the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy by theCentre for Internet and SocietyWe would like to begin by noting our appreciation for theforward-thinking nature of the government that is displayed by itspursuit of a policy on sharing of governmental data and enabling its useby citizens. We believe such a policy is a necessity in alladministratively and technologically mature democracies. In particular,we applaud the efforts to make this applicable through a negative listof data that shall not be shared rather than a positive list of datathat shall be shared, hence making sharing the default position.However, we believe that there are many ways in which this policy can bemade even better than it already is.## 1. NameWe believe that nomenclature of the policy must accurately reflect boththe content of the policy as well as prevailing usage of terms. Giventhat 'accessibility' is generally used to mean accessibility for personswith disabilities, it is advisable to change the name of the policy.### Recommendation:A. We would recommend calling this the ""National Open Data Policy"" toreflect the nomenclature already established for similar policies inother nations like the UK. In the alternative, it could be called a""National Public Sector Information Reuse Policy"". If neither of thoseare acceptable, then it could be re-titled the ""National Data Sharingand Access Policy"".## 2. Scope and EnforceabilityIt is unclear from the policy what all departments it covers, andwhether it is enforceable.### Recommendation:A. This policy should cover the same scope as the Right to Information(RTI) Act: all 'public authorities' as defined under the RTI Act shouldbe covered by this policy.B. Its enforceability should be made clear by including provisions onconsequences of non-compliance.## 3. CategorizationThe rationale for the three-fold categorization is unclear. Inparticular, it is unclear why the category of 'registered access'exists, and on what basis the categorization into 'open access' and'registered access' is to be done. If the purpose of registration is totrack usage, there are many better ways of doing so without requiringregistration.### Recommendation:A. Having three categories of:-   Open data-   Partially restricted data-   Restricted dataB. Data that is classified as non-shareable (as per a reading of s.8 ands.9 of RTI Act as informed by the decisions of the Central InformationCommission) should be classified as ‘restricted’.C. The rationale for classifying data as 'open' or 'partiallyrestricted' should be how the data collection body is funded. If itdepends primarily on public funds, then the data it outputs shouldnecessarily be made fully open. If it is funded primarily throughprivate fees, then the data may be classified as 'partially restricted'.'Partially restricted' data may be restricted for non-commercial usage,with registration and/or a licence being required for commercial usage.## 4. LicenceNo licence has been prescribed in the policy for the data. Despite Indianot allowing for database rights, it still allows for copyright overoriginal literary works, which includes original databases. Allgovernmental works are copyrighted by default in India, just as they arein the UK. To ensure that this policy goes beyond merely providingaccess to data to ensure that people are able to use that data, it mustprovide for a conducive copyright licence.### Recommendation:A. The licence that has been created by the UK government (anothercountry in which all governmental works are copyrighted by default) maybe referred to:http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/B. However, the UK needed to draft its own licence because the conceptof database rights are recognized in the EU, which is not an issue herein India. Thus, it would be preferable to use the Open Data Commons -Attribution licence:http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/The UK licence is compatible with both the above-mentioned licence aswell as with the Creative Commons - Attribution licence, and includesmany aspects that are common with Indian law, e.g., bits on usage ofgovernmental emblems, etc.## 5. Integrity of the dataCurrently, there is no way of ensuring that the data that is put out bythe data provider is indeed the data that has been downloaded by a citizen.### Recommendation:It is imperative to require data providers to provide integrity checks(via an MD5 hash of the data files, for instance) to ensure thattechnological corruption of the data can be detected.## 6. Authenticity of the dataCurrently, there is no way of ensuring that the data that is put out bythe data provider indeed comes from the data provider.### Recommendation:It is preferable to require data providers to authenticate the data byusing a digital signature.## 7. Archival and versioningThe policy is silent on how long data must be made available.### Recommendation:There must be a system of archival that is prescribed to enable citizensto access older data. Further, a versioning and nomenclature system isrequired alongside the metadata to ensure that citizens know the periodthat the data pertains to, and have access to the latest data by default.## 8. Open standardsWhile the document does mention standards-compliance, it is preferableto require open standards to the greatest extent possible, and requirethat the data that is put out be compliant with the InteroperabilityFramework for e-Governance (IFEG) that the government is currently inthe process of drafting and finalizing.### Recommendation:A. The policy should reference the National Open Standards Policy thatwas finalised by the Department of Information Technology in November2010, as well as to the IFEG.B. The data should be made available, insofar as possible, in structureddocuments with semantic markup, which allows for intelligent querying ofthe content of the document itself. Before settling upon ausage-specific semantic markup schema, well-established XML schemasshould be examined for their suitability and used wherever appropriate.It must be ensured that the metadata are also in a standardized anddocumented format.## 9. Citizen interactionOne of the most notable failings of other governments' data stores hasbeen the fact that they don't have adequate interaction with the citizenprojects that emerge from that data. For instance, it is sometimes seenthat citizens may point out flaws in the data put out by the government.At other times, citizens may create very useful and interesting projectson the basis of the data made public by the government.### Recommendation:A. The government's primary datastore (data.gov.in) should cataloguesuch citizen projects, including open and documented APIs that the havebeen made available for easy access to that data.B. Additionally the primary datastore should act as a conduit forcitizen's comments and corrections to the data provider. Data providersshould be required to take efforts to keep the data up-to-date.C. Multiple forms of access should preferably be provided to data, toallow non-technical users interactive use of the data through the Web.## 10. Principles, including 'Protection of Intellectual Property'It is unclear why ‘protection of intellectual property’ is one of theguiding principles of this policy. Only those ideals which are promotedby this policy should be designated as ‘principles’. This policy,insofar as we can see, has no relation whatsoever with protection ofintellectual property. The government is not seeking to enforcecopyright over the data through this policy. Indeed, it is seeking toencourage the use of public data. Indeed, the RTI Act makes it clear ins.9 that government copyright shall not act as a barrier to access toinformation.Given that, it makes no sense to include ‘protection of intellectualproperty’ amongst the principles guiding this policy. Further, there aresome other principles that may be removed without affecting the purposeor aim of this document: ‘legal conformity’ (this is a given since apolicy wouldn’t wish to violate laws); ‘formal responsibility’(‘accountability’ encapsulates this); ‘professionalism’(‘accountability’ encapsulates this); ‘security’ (this policy isn’tabout promoting security, though it needs to take into account securityconcerns).### Recommendation:A. Remove ‘protection of intellectual property’, ‘legal conformity’,‘formal responsibility’, ‘professionalism’, and ‘security’ from the listof principles in para 1.2.=======  [National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy]:http://dst.gov.in/NDSAP.pdf-- Pranesh PrakashProgramme ManagerCentre for Internet and SocietyW: http://cis-india.org | T: +91 80 40926283On Sunday 22 May 2011 12:52 PM, Laina Emmanuel wrote:> Dearest all,> I believe the section on principles needs to be reworked> 1.

 In total, this is coming up to Rs. 910,603,234,300,000, which is equal to USD 20.23 trillion. With this huge amount, India will become a super-power overnight and can permanently kill all social problems mainly poverty and unemployment.
 Take a detailed look at the list. Great work by the person who compiled it. Forward this to all Indians!! Others also have a right to know where their money is going..

I agree. The credibility is 
debatable. It is interesting to note here that the amount quoted in the 
biggest ""scam"" in this list (the money lying in Swiss banks) is greater 
than the total assets under management at the biggest Swiss Bank there 
is (UBS). Heck- the overall amount is greater than the GDP of the United
 States. 

Of course, there's no denying that there are loads of scams (most of 
which we aren't aware of), but the credibility of the numbers here is 
certainly debatable.

Finding the balance is the challenge. Narrow focus affords depth, but it's harder to find folks interested in just that.

We'll have to start somewhat broad and narrow down in future editions as the community grows. This list is dominated by folks with an interest in public data, but I expect there's a far wider audience of folks with private data. Let's say a three track conversation:

Department of Space (DOS) of the Government of India shall be the nodal agency for all actions under this policy, unless otherwise stated.1. For operating a remote sensing satellite from India, license and/ or permission of the Government, through the nodal agency, shall be necessary.     a. As a national commitment and as a “public good”, Government assures a continuous and improved observing/ imaging capability from its own Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS) programme.     b. The Government, through the nodal agency, shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all data collected/ received from IRS. All users will be provided with only a license to use the said data, and add value to the satellite data.     c. Government reserves the right to impose control over imaging tasks and distribution of data from IRS or any other Indian remote sensing satellite, when it is of the opinion that national security and/ or international obligations and/ or foreign policies of the Government so require.2. For acquisition/ distribution of remote sensing data within India, license/ permission from the Government of India, through the nodal agency, shall be necessary.     a. Government reserves the right to select and permit agencies to acquire/ distribute satellite remote sensing data in India. DOS shall be competent to decide on the procedure for granting license/ permission for dissemination of such data, and for the levy of necessary fees.     b. To cater to the developmental needs of the country, the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)/ DOS is vested with the authority to acquire and disseminate all satellite remote sensing data in India, both from Indian and foreign satellites.         i. NRSC shall enter into appropriate arrangements with DOS for acquiring/ distributing data from IRS within the visibility circle of NRSC’s receiving station(s).         ii. NRSC and/ or Antrix Corporation Ltd., shall be competent to enter into agreements with foreign satellite operator(s) for acquisition/distribution of foreign satellite data in India. However, NRSC will distribute the data as per terms agreed to with Antrix Corporation Ltd.     c. NRSC shall maintain a systematic National Remote Sensing Data Archive, and a log of all acquisitions/ sales of data for all satellites.3. For acquisition and distribution of IRS data for use in countries other than India, the Government of India, through the nodal agency, shall grant license to such bodies/ agencies of those countries as are interested in the acquisition/ distribution of IRS data, as per specific procedures.     a. The Antrix Corporation Ltd. (of DOS) is vested with the authority for receiving the applications for grant of license for acquisition/ distribution of IRS data outside of India; to consider and decide on the granting of license within the policy considerations of the Government, and to enter into licensing agreements with the prospective users on behalf of the Government. Antrix Corporation Ltd. shall also be competent to levy such fees for granting licenses as may be considered appropriate by it. It shall also be responsible, where necessary, for rendering any further help/ guidance needed by the license.     b. The Government reserves right to impose restrictions over imaging tasks and distribution of IRS data in any country when it is of the opinion that national security and/ or international obligations and/ or foreign policies of the Government so require.4.

All data of resolutions up to 1 m shall be distributed on a non- discriminatory basis and on “as requested basis”.     b. With a view to protect national security interests, all data of better than 1 m resolution shall be screened and cleared by the appropriate agency prior to distribution; and the following procedure shall be followed:         1. Government users namely, Ministries/ Departments/ Public Sector/ Autonomous Bodies/ Government R&D institutions/ Government Educational/ Academic Institutions, can obtain the data without any further clearance.         2. Private sector agencies, recommended at least by one Government agency, for supporting development activities, can obtain the data without any further clearance.         3. Other private, foreign and other users, including web based service providers, can obtain the data after further clearance from an inter- agency High Resolution Image Clearance Committee (HRC), already in place.         4. Specific requests for data of sensitive areas, by any user, can be serviced only after obtaining clearance from the HRC.         5.

This has been a constant thought in my head. We (Accountability Initiative) build demand for data at the grassroots level in two ways-> We do a whole of data journalism making sure that the data we collect is data that would directly affect people (like it would affect the education of their children etc). Then we take the results of our data-journalism back to the people in the forms of posters etc
-> The second way we do it, and this is more interesting, is by a course. We have built a course on how to track public finance right from the central govt to the govt schools. We train people at the grassroots level on this course. Once people understand how to get data, they are much more interested. Do you think a similar course on ""Open Data"" would help?

duties and obligations, the training here is to make NPOs and the
media aware of sources of data and sets of data (that are either
available or should be) to build demand?I agree. I've realized in the process of creating the PAISA course, that coming up with a table of contents of learning goals is a wonderful way to clarify ideas and take the conversation forward. So I've come up with an initial list here. Any learner who goes through this course should be able to.........

1. Broadly divide the various public data sources into govt and non-govt sources
Govt data sources2. Understand the structure of govt both in terms of executive, judiciary and legislature as well as the 3 levels of govt - Central, State and Local Government 
3. List various digital data sources at each of these levels. 
4. List the various non-digital data-sources at each of these levels
Non-Govt Data Sources5. Use RTI to access this data keeping in mind the restrictions on accessing private data
6. Know and Use technologies like data-scraping etc which help in getting this data7. Know and Use technologies which help in analyzing data and giving a new perspective on dataAre there broad obvious things I am missing out on?

To whom it may concern,
Security is one of the biggest issues in
urban policy debates today. In most discussions, however, the word ‘security’
is understood in terms of ‘hard security issues’, like acts of terrorism, law
and order situations, etc. 
In March 2011, MOD organised a workshop to explore various nuances of the sense of security in an urban context. We intended to expand the
notion and incorporate different forms of securities and insecurities – from environmental
to emotional – that are part of everyday urban lives. In process, we wanted to
broaden the dimensions of a ‘secure city.’
One of the documentation tools we experimented with in that workshop is mapping of participants’ experiences and observations about
secure and insecure spaces in the city of Bangalore. Though constrained by the limited and biased experiences of the people present, the exercise  was found inspiring and we wanted to expand it into a crowd-sourced mapping project. CSTEP came in as an engaged and creative collaborator.


Please visit the 'Bangalore Security Map' at bsm.mod.org.in and share your observations regarding the spaces of insecurity in the city of Bangalore.

 
We want to know where in the city you
feel insecure and why so. 
 
Further, if you feel insecure at a
certain part of the city (at a certain time perhaps), please share with us what
could have make you feel otherwise.
 
Not all senses of security or insecurity
are place-specific, not all of them can be pinned to a certain location in the
map. In such cases, please feel free to pin them where the name of the city
(‘Bangalore’) is shown (or maybe the neighbourhood which you are familiar with)
on the map.
 
For the map-hackers and data-wizards out
there, we will keep publishing all submitted information in .csv format once every two months.
Please use the published data to create maps and other visualisations, and
share it with us and other participants in this initiative.
 
We are hopeful that a map such as this
will create various new discussions about the city, will make possible different ways of observing the city and making it more livable.
 
The portal is developed collaboratively by CSTEP and MOD, using the Ushahidi
platform ('Luanda').'Bangalore Security Map' on MOD site: http://www.mod.org.in/mod/2011/06/bangalore-security-map/

We could dothis for Indian stocks - and I think I could use the Infovis toolkitand some jQuery-enabled progress bars for the rest. This would be funand yes, I have data for the last 17 years :)But you can't do that for inflation where the sum is 100 no matterwhat you do :) Since the sizes of the boxes are the weight, they don'tchange over time. What can be done is to weight the boxes by inflation(but that doesn't make too much sense either since you might see agrape taking inordinately large space).One idea then is to multiply the inflation in that component by itsweight, which then means you get the impact of inflation in thatcomponent. (So Onions could go up 40% but its impact on inflation ismuch lesser (say 3%). The colour can be the inflation itself. Justthinking aloud. If you're getting confused here - I can try and createa sample viz to demonstrate.See my article at Yahoo on how Onion Prices are not quite as important;http://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/Did-know-yahoofinancein-1004557077.html> I've been looking for a widget to do this, but nothing suitable has emerged.> BTW, I'm not sure if the legend is reflected in the visualisation. -5% is> indicated as blue, 0% as gray, and +5% as orange, but the graph has> electricity (+3.6%) as blue.Ah, thanks for the heads up.

Beentrying to think of ways to visualize it. I try to list out thequestions I have about the data and then pick a visualization.Challenge of course is -is there a visualization that can answer as many questions as possible?And the more I look at the data the more questions I have about it.So was just wondering if anyone here is interested in ""brainstorming""about it? Basically interested to know how you would go aboutvisualizing this kind of data. I think it would have to be anarrative/interactive as there are just so many variables.Here's part of the data from the site -https://spreadsheets0.google.com/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0AoU334PPvnxNdGh5ZnZyQVhIYWRWaVNoSHh1TzlTY0E&output=htmlHere is a bit of the story (highly likely there are mistakes)-70-75% of our consumption comes from importing two different types ofcrude. The price of which is combined and called a basket price.As far as I can tell the internally produced crude is also bought atthis price.If crude oil which is refined into all kinds of petroleum productslike (diesel, LPG, kerosene, naptha etc) is 100$ a barrelAt 100$ a barrel and 1$=45Rs, 1 litre of crude costs Rs. 28.31Now to take just one product of refining the crude- petrol -This is kind of how the pump prices per litre is calculated (I think)(refinery price + excise + dealer commission) * state vat = pump pricedropping data for Tamil Nadu into the equation(x+14.35+ 1.218) * 1.27 = 61.99x = 33.244 [approximate price of petrol at the refinery gate]I am not fully sure the reason for such a difference but from what Ihave read it maybe to control consumption and provide states somesteady revenue. Same thing applies to Diesel, LPG and Kerosene onlything is there is a government subsidy on top of it. Every time thecrude prices go up (or currencies oscillate) all kinds of beautifulthings happen. So having a nice big picture of the whole cycle wherepeople can fiddle with the variables is what I am dreaming about."

The government first attaches hajaar taxes.Then it provides a subsidy - so technically it would be equivalent tojust reducing the tax. there's was a major accounting rigmarole theyused to do till last year for the subsidy (off-balance-sheet bondissuances) which they have stopped now,a nd they literally pay out thesubsidy every year. Which is dumb because if they just reduced thetaxes they wouldn't have to first collect all this money and then payit out.Yes, states have to be compensated as part of excise and they get allthe vat. But that can still be organized.For the formula, I think weshould get it confirmed from anyone who's in the industry - just toget to know if we're right. But yes, the gate refined price of petrolwas around Rs. 30 when I last checked (Crude was $85)Anyway comign to the viz part.Maybe interesting to have an India mapwith state wise prices, VAT and consumption - click on the state andit splits into the individual components, VAT, Excise, SAD etc. Manyother data to visualize - for instance look at product exports - weexport ENORMOUS quantities of product - nearly 1/3rd of what Indiauses. In three years, we will probably double or a bit more.Also India can refine some really heavy sour crude, where the refiningmargins are much more. The brent crude (which like libyan crude islight and sweet) versus heavy sour (types found in iran, saudi) diffcan be as much as $15 per barrel.

A golden rule in most mailing lists is : never have attachments. Most people do now know you and many(like me), do not click onunknown links or attachments. Prefer having text in the email.So this role is in Azim Premji Foundation? What does this team currently do?
It would be nice to know more about such teams operating in India - whether they are for profit or not; and if the former, then how do they generate revenues.

Journal of Community Informatics:
Call for Papers for Special issue on Open Data
Guest editors:  Tim Davies, Practical Participation and Zainab Bawa, CIS-RAW fellow

Call for Proposals


The Journal of Community Informatics (http://ci-journal.net) is a focal point for the communication of research that is of interest to a global network of academics, Community Informatics practitioners and national and multi-lateral policy makers.
We invite submission of original, unpublished articles for a forthcoming special edition of the Journal that will focus on Open Data. We welcome research articles, case studies and notes from the field. All research articles will be double blind peer-reviewed. Insights and analytical perspectives from practitioners and policy makers in the form of notes from the field or case studies are also encouraged. These will not be peer-reviewed.


 Why a special issue on Open Data


In many countries across the world, discussions, policies and developments are actively emerging around open access to government data. It is believed that opening up government data to citizens is critical for enforcing transparency and accountability within the government. Open data is also seen as holding the potential to bring about greater citizens’ participation, empowering citizens to ask questions of their governments via not only the data that is made openly available but also through the interpretations that different stakeholders make of the open data. Besides advocacy for open data on grounds of democracy, it is also argued that opening government data can have significant economic potential, generating new industries and innovations.
Whilst some open government data initiatives are being led by governments, other open data projects are taking a grassroots approach, collecting and curating government data in reusable digital formats which can be used by specific communities at the grassroots and/or macro datasets that can be used/received/applied in different ways in different local/grassroots contexts. INGOs, NGOs and various civil society and community based organizations are also getting involved with open data activities, from sharing data they hold regarding aid flows, health, education, crime, land records, demographics, etc, to actively sourcing public data through freedom of information and right to information acts. The publishing of open data on the Internet can make it part of a global eco-system of data, and efforts are underway in technology, advocacy and policy-making communities to develop standards, approaches and tools for linking and analysing these new open data resources. At the same time, there are questions surrounding the very notion of ‘openness’, primarily whether openness and open data have negative repercussions for particular groups of citizens in certain social, geographic, political, demographic, cultural and other grassroots contexts.
In sum then, what we find in society today is not only various practices relating to open data, but also an active shift in paradigms about access and use of information and data, and notions of “openness” and “information/data”. These emerging/renewed paradigms are also configuring/reconfiguring understandings and practices of “community” and “citizenship”. We therefore find it imperative to engage with crucial questions that are emerging from these paradigm shifts as well as the related policy initiatives, programmatic action and field experiences.
Some of the questions that we hope this special issue will explore are:
How are citizens’ groups, grassroots organizations, NGOs, diverse civil society associations and other public and private entities negotiating with different arms of the state to provide access to government data both in the presence and absence of official open data policies, freedom/right of information legislations and similar commitments on the part of governments? 


What are the various models of open data that are operational in practice in different parts of the world? What are the different ways in which open data are being used by and for the grassroots and what are the impacts (positive, negative, paradoxical) of such open data  for communities and groups at the grassroots?


Who/which actors are involved in opening up what kinds of data? What are their stakes in opening up such data and making it available for the public?  


What are the different technologies that are being used for publishing, storing and archiving open data? What are the challenges/issues that various grassroots users and the stakeholders, experience with respect to these technologies i.e., design, scale, costs, dissemination of the open data to different publics and realizing the potential of open data?


What notions of openness and publicness are at work in both policies as well as initiatives concerning open data and what impacts do these notions have on grassroots’ practitioners and users?  


Following from the above, what are the implications of opening up different kinds of data for privacy, security and local level practices and information systems?  


Thematic focus
The following suggested areas of thematic focus (policy, technology, uses, impacts) give a non-exhaustive list of potential topic areas for articles or case studies. The core interest of the special issue is addressing each of these themes from, or taking into account, grassroots, local citizen and community perspectives.

Different policy and practice approaches to open data and open government data

Diverse uses of open data and their impacts

Technologies that are deployed for implementing open data and their implications

Critical assessments of stakeholders and stakes in opening up different kinds of data.

4507,Arun Ganesh,#topic/datameet/yTKpLK6mtKs,1,2011-03-09 03:22:00,Licensing crowdourced data projects,"This is a rather interesting topic to discuss in detail, since a lot of us are involved in projects crowdsourcing data. As the openstreetmap wiki[1] says, facts like pincodes cannot be copyrighted and is not protected by copyright law, and creative commons being a copyright license[2] is not suitable for such data collection projects in the first place. 
There is now a new type of license which should ideally be used for such data collection called the open data commons [3], but the awareness about it is almost nil and unlike creative commons which shot to stardom thanks to the wikipedia project, there isn't any notable project that uses this license yet (openstreetmap would be the biggest, if the community accepts it). Using the open data license for crowdsourced data projects seems the most suitable, if we go by the arguments put forth by the openstreetmap foundation [4], but nobody is using it yet and maybe its not such a wise decision to jump onto it yet.
That said, the other alternative is creative commons and although unsuitable, has become the defacto standard for such crowdsourced community projects. We need to take a call on which cc license is in the best interests of improving the data collection and sharing.
Personally, my vote is for cc-by-sa[5] as it is in tune with your regular copyleft which requires the derivative work to be distributed with a compatible license. Its sounds like a fair enough condition to impose and makes sure that the data collected can keep on improving over time. On the other hand, the plain cc-by[6] license may be more liberal but is not in the spirit of open data since it would allow a company to use the crowdsourced database and not share any improvements and corrections back with the community. An open data project can be totally hijacked for commercial gains this way.

Sadly, I can think of a way around this easily. Some commentary here:
http://www.osmfoundation.org/wiki/License/Why_CC_BY-SA_is_Unsuitable

The one way around this is to keep the OSM data set independent of
everything else, display it independently and return changes to OSM as
mandated by the SA license. The other option, is to ask AND if they
can independently license it to data meet under a vanilla BY license.

Only reason I picked CC-BY is because http://www.geonames.org/ is CC-BY and that's where my initial dataset is from. I can convert that to a CC-BY-SA, right?
Am tempted not to use CC-BY-SA. Attribution is fine, but forcing others to share alike... commercial use would be restricted.
Arun, any chance OSM can be used without ShareAlike?RegardsAnandPS: I was just about to upload the 2,000-odd unique PIN codes from datameet when I saw this. Stopped just in time :-)

Just a point here - the Datameet data set is CC-BY licensed and this
AND is CC-BY-SA licensed. They don't play nicely - you can include AND
in the Datameet set only if the Datameet set is CC-BY-SA licensed too.

If they aren't sure maybe it can default to a share alike license, as the point of all this I hope is ""open data"". More than anything making it default to an SA type license gets people to think about intent. It also helps volunteers decide which projects they want to contribute to. 
Expecting the community with its varied interests, to come to some kind of consensus on license issues is not a great idea."

If you wanted to use the community's work, you had to play by their rules. The FSF emphasized this with a copyright assignment policy. To contribute to an FSF GPLed project, you also had to assign your copyright to them. They demanded this so they could legally represent the code in GPL violation cases.Many other projects adopted the same approach, most notably MySQL, which also found a business model in commercial licensing since they owned absolute copyright.Today, this model is seen as horribly wrong. MySQL's new owner Oracle presents a credible threat of discontinuing updates to the open source edition. LibreOffice forked from OpenOffice for the same reason.Copyright assignment is now seen as evil, and by extension, the GPL with its restrictions on freedoms is also evil.BSD and other liberal licenses (MIT, Apache, etc) are the new darlings. Any sensible company now recognizes the value of community contribution, so the license isn't the place to demand it of them.CC-By-SA vs CC-By is a similar argument. SA may seem like a safety net in the early period, but it'll be seen as an impediment in future. For example, what if someone wants to merge CC-By-SA data with commercially licensed data for a special application? The resulting data is technically a violation of the SA clause, so they will have to (a) keep these datasets separate and overlay rather than merge them, or (b) not touch SA data at all. One is a pain, the other is the community's loss.Kiran"

If the intention is for maximum use of the data, then it should just be released into the public domain, no? But the problem when you are generating and maintaining data through community participation is that it requires continuous input to ensure the data gets more complete and accurate as time goes on (like wikipedia) . For that to happen it is essential that a) Everyone who uses the data knows about the project so that they know where to contribute if needed and b) Maintain tools and a platform that will enable active participation of a community around the data
While (a) is taken care of by having a license that requires attribution, for (b) it is necessary that the project is structured in such a way that the community feels that they retain the ownership to the data. Without this you might be able to build a community initially, but it seems unlikely it will have an organic growth and will self sustain. Using open source tools and having GPL style licenses reassures the community that the project is in their hands.
Some of the more interesting links have expired from my browser's history, unfortunately, but a quick summary of links from around ten years ago vs more recently:

Kiran, I have no arguments in the domain of software licensing, but in the case of data, somehow I am convinced that we need copyright assignment to 'force' more data to be open. Data, being factual knowledge has a much more critical role to play in our daily lives than software code. 
Leaving aside the nitty-gritties of licensing, what really matters is that open data remains just that - open, for eternity. cc-by-sa is certainly not the answer as it does run into problems when used with non free data like you pointed out. I have a feeling that the answer may lie somewhere in Open data commons[1], but i'm still generally foggy on which path to take.
It will be interesting to look at some notable crowdourcing projects and see how they licensed their data.[1] http://www.opendatacommons.org/guide/

You cant even use a map because there is no large scale public domain map data available anywhere to use!I dont know how many would agree, but after wikipedia came to the fore, i have noticed that the -BY-SA license has become a defacto standard for the new generation of projects dealing with open content. I would guess that the pool of knowledge being licensed under -BY-SA is growing much much more rapidly than under any other license scheme. The pool is big and growing fast, and when the condition is that you need to make the pool bigger, i dont see why not. My fascination with -BY-SA is that work is both everybody's and nobody's.

are not required to contribute back, it is just a one way street.I suspect that's a little simplistic. Code doesn't exist in isolation. Code isn't static. Code and coders form a symbiotic relationship. Code must constantly evolve to adapt to the changing environment -- new hardware, newly discovered security vulnerabilities, evolving APIs, or entirely new paradigms.
You can't just take code, ignore the developers who maintain it, and expect to get something useful out of it. Forking a project to take it closed is expensive. You're cutting yourself off from the great talent pool of the open community, and keeping your closed changes in sync with the open codebase is painful.
A share alike license is a great defensive tool for a small project, but after a while the sheer size and momentum of the community will suffice, without any of the downsides of a rigid SA license.
However: if you're small and trying something that's been resisted before, the SA license is critical. The trouble is with knowing when to lose it.Kiran

Wouldn't making budget the 'parent' and actual, estimates and revisions the 'child' give comparative. I played with awesome code playground http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/?type=visualization#tree_map.

The animation version kindles the child in me :-)  
Yeah, subtractions are an issue. Generally, I just take the net figures and skirt around the problem. Would love to hear if anyone has other ideas.My ideas towards analysis budget would be story driven.
Effect of budget in select items (petrol, food, loan, education, etc). Selecting the items will give 'effect' of budget on the item. It can be increase in price. Visualizing importance (or performance) given to sectors in budget. It can be similar to treemap, instead of boxes or within the boxes we have images of different sector...petrol, power or tax etc. Measuring importance is difficult. 
Visualizing if the budget will increase or decrease the burden of common urban man, rural-farmer etc~ Ananth

Frankly I haven't spend time on the budget data. Will have a look at it. Effect on people could be based on 'consumption basket' or better 'living basket'. We can assume set of items for that like - rice, petrol, rent, income tax etc that a urban middle class family or upward mobile family will use. Once that is fixed we can see how budget affects the price of the 'living basket'. Some of the newspaper have attempted this. If we have enough data, we can have 'effect' trend-line of the 'living basket' for each budget for last 20 years - it will be nice.
